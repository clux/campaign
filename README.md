# Campaign 2018-2021
DM notes and brain organisation of a 3 year D&D campaign.
Lots of unfinished ideas and clutter, but in general this organisational style was successful.

## Foam Usage
We use [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) as a [campaign brain](https://clux.github.io/probes/post/2020-09-27-second-brain/).

You need to follow the [last steps of foam install](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#getting-started) to browse effectively (clone repo, open as workspace, install recommended extensions).

The main feature this gives is the ability to [follow markdown links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links)

## Organisation
Folders generally specify regions. Sometimes the folders also coincide entirely with chapters, but in some chapters players move around a lot.

1. Introduction for [Sunless Citadel](./waterdeep/sunless-citadel.md) :: EP 1-4
2. Segued [Into the Abyss](./underdark) :: EP 4-19
3. Escape, [Whiteplume](./whiteplume), and [Civilization](./waterdeep/waterdeep.md) :: EP 20-30
4. [Seafaring](./seaofbones) on the [Artemis](./seaofbones/artemis.md) :: EP 31-46
5. [Neverwinter](./north/neverwinter.md) & [Luskan](./north/luskan.md) in the [north](./north) :: EP 45-56
6. The subjugate [giants](./spine) and undead opposition :: EP 57-81
7. Following the Undead Trail [East](./east) and [getting help](./factions/silver-helix.md) :: EP 82-105
8. Into the Shadowfell to deal with the [Undying Soul](./factions/undying-soul.md) :: EP 106-12X

In general, the [recaps folder](./recaps) is going to be the best bet to get a chronological feel.
