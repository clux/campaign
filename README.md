# Campaign 2018-2021
DM notes and brain organisation from a 3 year D&D 5e campaign.

## Second Brain
This repo uses [foam](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) as a [campaign brain](https://clux.github.io/probes/post/2020-09-27-second-brain/).

To browse effectively; follow the [last steps of foam install](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#getting-started) (clone repo, open as workspace, install recommended extensions).

The main feature this gives is the ability to [follow markdown links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links) effectively.

## Organisation
Folders generally specify regions, these sometimes coincide entirely with chapters of the campaign, but often not due to the amount of quick teleports between them.
