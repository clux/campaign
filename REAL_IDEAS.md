# 2060s London
- US + UK total police states ruled by lobbying plutocrats
- China controls most of Asia through force
- UK has mediterranean temperatures
- Northern regions the most densely populated in the world
- Equator is the exclusion zone

## Religions
### XR
Xtinction Religion - uprising protesters turned violent
slaughtered large amount of "enemies of humanity" everywhere
believed by many to have slowed the onslaught of climate change
A network of hackers with access to global weapon supplies, trying to hold unethical plutocrats hostage.
### Investors
The richest plutocrats in UK/US/China (infernals). Controls 99% of the worlds wealth.
Constantly PR battling with a green label. Technology as the answer.
Nano-Technology provided to new acolytes let them summon police drones at will.
Hell is in Europe; one level in Paris. Champs-Élysées is a walled fortress.
Make them European. Not actually trading souls, but the suffering for money is equivalent.

- Gorfilax the Insatiable (archfiend)
nicodaemus - fiddler of the crossroads; the devil: (in charge of one town)
- why does bad things happen to good people? "because they do it to themselves, they want it to happen"
- collecting souls part of a larger beauraucracy; heaven and hell are not opposed, heaven rewards the just, hell punishes the wicked; two sides of the same scheme, two offices in the same company. 90% of the time heaven and hell are working towards the same end.
- a lot wicked people live in very comfortable countries and live very comfortable, boring lives, and backdoor their way into heaven; but they were bad the whole time, just never had a shot to do something wicked. so devils like me just give these people a shot to show their true colors. you know the guy at the bar with a big mouth (oh, he's just a crank, he's harmless), if he was the prime minister he'd be a fucking war criminal. so a lot of what we do is offer power and temptation, kind of stress testing the system.
## Scandis
Norwegians/Swedes/Finns who locked their gates and enclosed themselves off from the world and lives semi-peacefully off oil money and hydropower. Barbarians with high technology. Technologial utopia that only sustain 3m people. Strict gates.
Together defend the eastern front vs russia.
