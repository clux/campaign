# 2060s London
- US + UK total police states ruled by lobbying plutocrats
- China controls most of Asia through force
- UK has mediterranean temperatures
- Northern regions the most densely populated in the world
- Equator is the exclusion zone
- 3 degree warming
- Coal still primary power source, relics of renewables maintained for minimum wage in exclusion zones
- 1 billion people left
- Most died from agricultural collapse
- Magic fueled by batteries - actually scientific

## Hot Start
Play the dramatic backstory of one NPC.
Have one player create a fake PC.

## Hot End
Need to work towards an end where they get to talk to the architect of society.
The ones behind the scenes of government.
Who is pulling thes trings? Religious orgs? Financial society struggling with regulation?

## Architects
In underwater bases (least likely to be touched by inevitable destruction)
biodomes.
subnautica/soma/atlantis <- inspiration

## Religions
### XR
Xtinction Religion - uprising protesters turned violent
slaughtered large amount of "enemies of humanity" everywhere
believed by many to have slowed the onslaught of climate change
A network of hackers with access to global weapon supplies, trying to hold unethical plutocrats hostage.
### Investors
The richest plutocrats in UK/US/China (infernals). Controls 99% of the worlds wealth.
Constantly PR battling with a green label. Technology as the answer.
Nano-Technology provided to new acolytes let them summon police drones at will.
Hell is in Europe; one level in Paris. Champs-Élysées is a walled fortress.
Make them European. Not actually trading souls, but the suffering for money is equivalent.

- Gorfilax the Insatiable (archfiend)
nicodaemus - fiddler of the crossroads; the devil: (in charge of one town)
- why does bad things happen to good people? "because they do it to themselves, they want it to happen"
- collecting souls part of a larger beauraucracy; heaven and hell are not opposed, heaven rewards the just, hell punishes the wicked; two sides of the same scheme, two offices in the same company. 90% of the time heaven and hell are working towards the same end.
- a lot wicked people live in very comfortable countries and live very comfortable, boring lives, and backdoor their way into heaven; but they were bad the whole time, just never had a shot to do something wicked. so devils like me just give these people a shot to show their true colors. you know the guy at the bar with a big mouth (oh, he's just a crank, he's harmless), if he was the prime minister he'd be a fucking war criminal. so a lot of what we do is offer power and temptation, kind of stress testing the system.
## Scandis
Norwegians/Swedes/Finns who locked their gates and enclosed themselves off from the world and lives semi-peacefully off oil money and hydropower. Barbarians with high technology. Technologial utopia that only sustain 3m people. Strict gates.
Together defend the eastern front vs russia.

## Oligarchs
Only wealthy leaders left of the largely desolate state. Natural resources mostly sold to China and its subsidiary aseanic states.

## Politics
The witch was targeted because a witch is a non-consuming class. Sorcery offers the idea of something for nothing; it offers a worldview where cosmic powers and fates are accessible to everyone. This worldview is incompatible with the capitalist order where life is transformed into the capacity to work.
> fears arise when one mode of production is supplanting another because the metaphysical order (how we see life, meaning, and the natural) is being challenged and replaced
sorcerers hunted (maybe the ones that use magic for own gain?). clerics allowed in churches / hospitals (but only for difficult cases, and you have to opt in to special treatment).
- Speak with dead is common during burials, resurrection viewed as taboo (via raise dead)
- Speak with dead for rulers; Ask Thatcher for guidance?
- Sorcery licenses? Regulation for clerics? Detection of misuse of magic from government / police.
- Police vans with nova like detect magic pulses. Asks for papers, and issues warnings.

each level is a seed round
cash infusion
optimize for shareholder value

illusion; taking the best of the electrical augmentations, focusing it on illusionism

## sorcerer
wild magic drugs. make new table.
perhaps one entirely rooted in philosophy?

## cleric
devoted to existing failed gods of christianity / judaism?
islam largely wiped out during the 40s cataclysm that created the exclusion zone.
priest -> pope tree? Pope has godly powers of resurrection.

suppose we need people working in healthcare as well. druids or clerics?

## MAGIC IS ENERGY FIELD
people have access to it (rich)
poor can hack it

## Races
Thieflings - sons of traders/investors
Dwarves/Gnomes - generally live underground or maintain construction or power infra
Elves - politicians?

## CHARACTER CREATION
Should really do this ASAP.

## Quests

## NPCS
Tons of desperately sad characters.
- Guy failing to jerk off and with cheeto dust all over him.
- Anti-police radicalists from a "model" minority that fight prosecution of their racial flaws (halflings,kobolds)
- See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oXiFuPCU6k - Cubbys from Dimension High

## HP Mechanic
You don't get more HP, you can just find better shields.
Shields normally regen after a 10 minutes.

Instead of health potions, there are lightning charges for your battery.
There are 4 slots in your armor, you can plug in one as a bonus action (effectively a health potion).
It will quick charge your battery over the course of one round (max one active at a time).
Once you've used one, the inject spot must be repaired (long rest).

Spotting low shield enemies? 50% flickering, 25% flashing red.

Roll under fluency under to read.

### Combat lull between RPG and Combat
Bullet time first move?
Give them a few minutes to prep combat.
(Wont work for suprises within the combat)


## Theatre
Too cheap to use human labour widely, but few shows that openly show them on stage.
`Adalon` is one such subversive show that actually celebrates its use of cheaper races.
