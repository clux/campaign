# akkhan tomb

diamond mine?
desert netherese?
acropolis?
Sunset Mountains - South of Netheril (in ruins)
Netheril east/west border is undead territory.

Heaven's Fury (Radiant energy d3 shotgun) helmet
Whenever hit with weapon, it hits with the power of kavaki in 3 directions
60 degree differentiation from center
Each beam carries same damage. So can in theory triple damage output.

But it stacks with Golden Scourge (so can do 3x3 smite hits against AoE)


can turn akkhan into a death knight near the acropolis
nice boss for the tomb.

## failure
Failure here can turn GW into a villain death knight?
