# Sunset Warriors
The champions of the east that bested Kiaransalee in Aruanoch 700y ago.
Shario + Akkhan + Sunwuko + Natalya.

## Items
Felgolos has Shario's Bracers + Akkhan's Ring
Some of Sharia's loot is in Halos, some in Waterdeep.
Sunwuko has one item in Halos, rest in shrine in eastern monastery.

## Akkhan
Tomb in a diamond mine - near boreal temple / icewind dale.

### Items
- Heaven's Fury (Radiant energy d3 shotgun) helmet
Whenever hit with weapon, it hits with the power of kavaki in 3 directions
60 degree differentiation from center. Each beam carries same damage. So can in theory triple damage output. __in tomb__
- Ring of Comdemnation (Can cast Comdemn 30ft radius con save vs 8d8 radiant dmg as an action once per day) __felgolos__

- +3 Two Handed Flail 2d6 (Golden Scourge - Divine Smite bounces 10 feet to up to 3 additional creatures) - an attempt to recreate Akkhan's weapon. Needs a 5th level radiant damage spell imbued plus the soul of Akkhan / 1000gp opal. Needs 21 strength __felgolos partial recreate__

NB: Heaven's fury stacks with Golden Scourge (so can do 3x3 smite hits against AoE)

### Tomb Boss
Death Knight Akkhan: https://i.redd.it/n9kv95j532y41.jpg
Failure here can turn GW into a villain death knight?

## Sunwuko
Shrine in Sunset Mountains - South of Netheril (in ruins)
Netheril east/west border is undead territory.

Sunwuko a master monk ruled the City of Shade. They had developed a completely different style of fighting to combat the stun-proof elites of the undead; avoidance, drain, + fast shooting weaponry (auto-reload crossbows).

Worshipped the Monkey King. Incredible agility gave him great prowess in battle and dancing.

### Items
- weapon that burns spell on crit roll D8+1 for level slot, but can only slow instead of stun. Gives truesight.
- spirit stone: grant Breath of Heaven spell (heal all allies within 30 ft - 25% of monk's health)
- auto-reloading crossbow (generate ki on hits, cannot stun while equipped?)
- Divine Rapier +2 (Cannot miss unless disadvantaged + amplifies dodge action, becomes completely immune to damage) __Halos__

TODO: something that nerfs stun, but perhaps boosts health regen/survivability?

### Tomb Boss
Solar programmed to not let anyone sully the burial site (knows if it hears a lie). Tons of destroyed skeletons nearby (that have tried).

## Shario
Burial chamber central to the mage's guild. Ursula takes the full lore and takes it to heart.
Diana + the others know the story, but considers it a fairy tale.

In Castle Waterdeep. But you can't just loot it unless there's a distraction happening. City guard elite near at hand.

### Items
- Shario's Bracers of Evocation (Boosts Evocation Spells, extra dmg dice to all spells of level > 0) __Felgolos__
- Moonlight Ward: When receiving fatal damage, you are instead restored to 100% maximum life and resources. The item is the rendered unmagical for the next 100 years __Burial Chamber__
- Ring of Lightning (Boosts lightning bolt Damage +2d6) __Ursula__
- Ring of Fire (Boosts Fireball range and damage, +20ft, +2d6) __Halos__

## Natalya
Arch-huntress and ruler of the Zemnian Empire. Not religious. Draconic pets. Knew Felgolos. Not known where she was buried.
and her legendary longbow.

### Items
- Kridershot: +3 (explosive bolts +d6 radiant damage)
- Yang's Recurve +3 (crit pulls enemies 15ft - 30ft pull range)
- Boots of Haste
- Elusive Ring (after using your reaction, you have resistance to all damage for one round) __Ursula__

## Kiaransalee's Resting Place
Ex-netherese Empire beneath Acropolis of Thanatos in V'elddrinnsshar.

Magically imbued scythe. Egg of Galadaeros (aka the Eternal Star) compressed as the pommel (given to the Arcane Brotherhood to protect).
Iridium Blade of Shadow, buried with Shario.
Staff of Thunder and Lightning (used to belong to Umnos, but he sealed it in Gilgrin) ((perhaps make it lightning only, but higher stun DC))

Could not be charmed, could not be stunned, and could not be transformed in any way. Attacks out of nothing (invis), and when angry.

Kiaransalee lost all her power when the hordes of her followers died in this clash (Helm Rift above the acropolis). Though the last remaining champion, Shario, distributed parts of her relics to various magocracies on the coast.

The handle was in Gilgrin, the pommel in the Luskan. But she still has to use the daemon lords to break Waterdeep to get the scythe.
