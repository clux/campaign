Seen at [[grundsgryn]].
![](./dahaka.jpg)

Ancient LE
Based on Prince of Peria; Warrior Within
Omnitemporal + Omnipresent

Came about due to netherese society starting to tamper with time.
Dahaka desires chronomancy to unwind chronomancy for his existence to end.

## Abandoned: Chase Scene Grundsgryn
Dahaka chase into Wave summoning an Elder elemental MTOF 198

## Mordai Challenge
Mordai does not have a god/patron anymore.
But upon death, he can get a chance to "unloop" his fate.
In a faded area with dahaka. He needs to cast chronomancy to align with the time.

He needs to end all time loops.
Mainly killing the 3 [[undying-soul]]
But also involving the people he's told about chronomancy.

In the challenge world his body will feel like jello. Attacks will fail. He can choose to totally disregard the Dahaka, but misses out on the offer.

### Looks
~~Winged devil ; black cornugon in full plate. wings probably under his armor.~~
~~GOO: infinitely many eyes, infinitely many screens.~~
~~Rick; Rogue time scientist gnome.~~
An enormous flying eye, eyelashes, and several petal like wings protruding on each side (sahaquiel, but more wing petals, like seraphim).


Shuffling a deck of cards repeatedly mid conversation.
Feet kicked up on desk. Watching multiple scrying orbs projected onto plates.
(Security TV screen)
He can switch between them seemlessly. Sometimes tracking people, sometimes location. Different screens show different times.

- "Spoilers. Spoilers. What fun is there if I know the ending to every story.."
- I take many forms. I simply took one that I thought would be comfortable for you. (infernal, eerily familiar; WIS25 like his mum's father, Melrath).

### Original Offer
- temporary resurrection for 1 month, and at the end, he will die
- he has to complete tasks below

if he declines the undercover mission (temporary immortality), hanir tieup starts immediately.

Show him Hanir Cutscene.

### Benefits
- while alive; true Divine Soul/Patron
- can cast any spell provided he has scroll; spell DC buffed to 20 somehow?
- can do a once per week full rest refresh (chronomancy refresh 30min ritual)

### Tasks
Needs to end the use and knowledge of [[chronomancy]]. I.e.:

- needs to kill Arklem/Irae/Kiaransalee
- need to kill or Modify Memory Ursula (8th level)
- need to kill or Modify Memory Celerom (8th level)

## Personality
Cop interrogation. Good cop.
Deep voice. Cockney geezer god.
Doesnt want spoilers, and reacts out of proportion, borderline evil.
Ultimately the deck didn't work. He controls it with his shuffling.
Hans always dies.

### Amended Offer
Wish => His life is not automatically forfeit after 1 month. He gets to live.

Same Tasks and benefits with one extra benefit (if asked)

- Swap `Flames` card for `Donjon` Hanir (see Hanir Interaction)

By doing this, [[hjarka]] can live (and she can potentially eulogise herself).

If he does not accept. Offer is rescinded.
God does nothing (or something worse, hjarka gets locked in too)
He is resurrected either way, but only with listed benefits if he accepts.

#### Offer Lines
- Fucking hell. Stage of wish. Well. This is either good for you or bad for you, and I can't tell you which is which (changes outcome).
- Legally, it's good for you.

- I would have requested a complete contract with a specific purpose normally, but you are legally free to return thanks to the state of Wish that we find ourselves in. However, you may want to listen to the following; THREATS.
- You will officially be the first creature I send back.
- You  champion. Don't worry about that title btw. I'm not you know who from your mother's side.

#### Threat Layer
- ~~Change card to affect Hjarka to send her back (figure 8 cycle, one half: hans's sad cycle, hjarka's sent back cycle, next iteration, party see an old hjarka and she gets killed)~~
- Your lives (regardless of your immediate outcomes) are locked in a state of determinism as long as Chronomancy exists. You think you have free will?
- As long as Chronomancy exists. Kiaransalee can return. If you do not succeed, Kiaransalee returns. If you succeed, then the cycle of her death, and her revival will continue every 500 years, and you will be the next sunset warriors. Until an iteration of you fails.
- Only wiping chronomancy entirely from the multiverse record will do it. I have done as much as possible to minimise its influence, but my choices rely on individual choice. (Hanir story).

offer still only for 1mo, after that "i know how your cycle ends, offer ends here"

### Questions
- Tell me. What do you know of Chronomancy. (jk, i have seen you)
- The dragon hoard that you stole, do you know where it came from?
- The gold that you got, what did you do with it?
- it's possible that you should not exist depending on what you did with that gold
- The only way to end this, is to cut the source of the magic
  * wizards who uses it, wipe their memory, destroy the knowledge

### Lines
State of Wish:
- Oh great, we're in a state of Wish. I guess you get to live after all.
- Yeah, I can't do what I normally do, because someone has invoked a Wish on you.
- You're lucky you know, your fate had a 3/4 probability of being tied to me.
- Not that it would have mattered in the long run, given the powers you are toying with.

Chronomancy was never intended to exist for mortals. It was distilled from the essence of mystra after her fall at the end of the netherese empire. I hoped the chaos they sent themselves on would be enough to end that energy use, but the knowledge lives on.
Dragon Hoard:
- Chronomancy has non-sensical effects on the multiverse. Someone takes something from the future, and brings it to the past; that item now exists in a time loop. It must end up in the location in the future to be stolen, yet has no concrete origin. It causes a sharp break from its original history, both creation and future, and shunts the universe into an increasingly constrained pocket with no real history or surprises.
- Where did the gold come from? No one knows anymore, our position in the multiverse is severed from the universe where the gold had a real origin.
- Spent gold? Well, that gold has to find its way back. The universe will conspire to do so, and by doing so, it becomes ever more strangely deterministic.
- Eventually the gold ends back with `Nihilant` until versions of yourselves are set to destroy him in about 50 years time. Thankfully, not many people interact with that island.

Paradoxical Summons: ok as long as you complete it. If you break it, you cause another paradox elsewhere.

TODO: Celerom: before powerful magician, now, they now how they are going to die?

## Hanir Interaction
Partially responsible for [[hanir]]'s demise. Gave him the DOMT originally.

He did this as an experiment to help end the chronomancy (since he interacted with party), but no deck order helped, so he's kept on the island as this is the route that minimizes further time convolution.

Chronomancy causes loops, and the greatest loops are caused by Hanir whose wild magic amplifies it.

At the end of campaign, dahaka shows him the alternate end of hans prove that [[hjarka]] survives.

#### Hanir Cutscene
You think spoilers/determinism is/are bad? I'll show you.
I have tried everything to change the life of the one responsible for the biggest time loops caused by chronomancy. Even I cannot do it.

**Intro Hans**
- Observe. (cut to young handsome angelic creature) A lowly sorcerer rejects his servitude under the divine. Tired of pointless fighting for Selune.
- (cut to him falling) Rebels against his former morality and leader, and almost ends up completely controlled by an undead mind controlling beast (feydark necromancer?) (show darkened wings, necrotic shroud, clutches staff).
- Then, he is rescued by your friend [[faey]].
- At this point, his life is about to take a turn, because unbeknownst to him, he now coexists with himself.
- (Screen locks in on Hans' face)
- His magical abilities starts failing him; because the weave is splits between the two versions of himself.
- Now, you know a large part of the rest. You travelled with this assimar.
- Every time you used your magic near him, he blacks out, or suffers catastrophic malfunctions of magic.

**Outro Hans (start)**
- He became aware of his future, and would go to any length to avoid it.
- I had the tools to permute his future and lessen the destructive impact he would have on the timeline, and I simply gave him the opportunity (shuffles deck).
- He was the perfect vessel for experimentation, because he represented the complete lack of determinism due to the unpredictable influence of chronomancy.
- (cut to him having the deck while talking to a hooded grey female) But his resolve was strong. He would not take the chance. He would take any opportunity to fix his future/past (depending on how you look at it), and he placed his faith in the first god whose acolytes he met.
- He got a cleric to take him to sea, in the hopes of Divine Intervention from the powers of Umberlee.

**Outro Hans (crazy shit)**
- I'm sure you're interested in how this ends.
- (improvise sea attack by a boat - empress, and Hans' accident, plus Flames card)
- (improvise cleric battling (unhood to reveal hjarka) failing battle with Pit Fiend, then Hans; Void, Fool Idiot)
- Tried everything. Tried even extracting his inner spirit and forcing it through a stable medium ([[faey]] with the focus), but the least destructive path was hist most confined path.

**Clarification if asked**:
- Dahaka gave Hans the cards. "Your future is determined by these cards. Pick the future one you want. One card in here (Moon w/Wishes) grants you the card to write your future as you see fit."
- The cleric? Oh, her outcome is irrelevant for Hans. In this deck variations she saves Hans by sacrificing herself to fight the Pit Fiend.
- Hanirs fate? Oh, he has to die. Everything you are doing and have been doing in the past (80 sessions) year depends on this. Any permutation where he lives, the world is in an unlivable state.
- Changing something? Of course, we're in a state of Wish, I can do whatever we want. That said. Some things cannot be changed for your sanity. Destiny.
- Change can't pertains to them. That would affect you and your encounter with Hanir, and then this encounter would not have happened. But that means you never tell young Hanir about his fate, and he goes on to create bigger time chaos with you.
- Destiny: You need to meet Hanir, he needs to die, and he needs to die spectacularly enough for you to warn him of his fate.
- Does he know they'll succeed. But can't tell them, because that will funnily enough cause the outcome to change.
