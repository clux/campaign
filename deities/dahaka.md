![](./dahaka.jpg)

Ancient LE
Based on Prince of Peria; Warrior Within
Omnitemporal + Omnipresent

Came about due to netherese society starting to tamper with time.
Dahaka desires chronomancy to unwind chronomancy for his existence to end.

## Abandoned: Chase Scene Grundsgryn
Dahaka chase into Wave summoning an Elder elemental MTOF 198

## Mordai Challenge
Mordai does not have a god/patron anymore.
But upon death, he can get a challenge to "unwind" his fate.

He needs to unwind a bunch of time loops. They will stop with the last of the 3 [[undying-soul]].

### Looks
Faded area with dahaka. He needs to cast chronomancy to align with the time. He will see one devil.
Winged devil ; black cornugon in full plate. wings probably under his armor.

- I take many forms. I simply took one that I thought would be most comfortable for you.

### Offer
Dahak will
- offer him temporary immortality for his purpose for 1 month, and at the end, he will die.
- afterwards: tie up the hanir loop triggered by mordai's chronomancy influencing the wild magic

if he declines the undercover mission (temporary immortality), hanir tieup starts immediately.

Deal:
- he gets to live for 1 month; true Divine Soul/Patron
- can cast any spell provided he has scroll; spell DC buffed to 20 somehow?
- can do a once per week full rest refresh (chronomancy refresh)
- needs to kill Arklem/Irae/Kiaransalee
- need to kill or Modify Memory Ursula (8th level)
- need to kill or Modify Memory Celerom (8th level)

### Amended Offer
Since they used Wish on Mordai, need to sweeten the deal a bit here.
He needs to do the same thing to come back, but he doesn't die at the end of 1 month (unless he fails to do those things).

## Personality
Cop interrogation. Good cop.
Deep voice. Cockney geezer god.
Feet kicked up on desk. Watching TV
"Spoilers. Spoilers." I know the ending to every movie now.

points to tv: celerom, before powerful magician, now, they now how they are going to die.
oh, you think it's good? [[hanir]]
(timelord thugs wanted gold back, time elementals / ancient faey / hierarchy of misery)
(hanir wild magic, chronomancy causes loops, greatest loop in hanir)
(tries to leave to stop his future from happening)
(walks into umberlee timeline)
(8 loop, part living, part dead?)
(he met hjarka, and she was the one who died? but only been a few months since he left...)
(hans met hjarka, fell in love, going to sail, )
show recognise the face of the girl
"oh you know more than one person of the story"
"if you do do this, can break the loop (he put the deck, shuffles the deck)"
gw deserves a reward for the wish magic, selune
"we're in a state of wish, i can do whatever we want"

hanir picked card; kraken (kills hjarka), second card (makes him mad)
(timelord changes card, s/kraken/prison/ card)
shuffles deck of cards
maybe he didn't draw the madness card, he just got old, senile on island
played with by umberlee
he was madly in love with hjarka
but then 200y in the past
hans was a simp

choice:
- card swap (and she lives), but he has to end chronomancy
- he does nothing, god does nothing (or something worse, hjarka gets locked in too)
in both ways he is resurrected
can threaten to change card to send her back (figure 8 cycle, one half: hans's sad cycle, hjarka's sent back cycle, next iteration, party see an old hjarka and she gets killed)
do they roll with that?
offer still only for 1mo, after that "i know how your cycle ends, offer ends here"

intention:
doesnt want spoilers, and reacts out of proportion, borderline evil


at the end of campaign, dahaka shows him the alternate end of hans
prove that they the cycle

- Tell me. When did you learn about chronomancy.
- The dragon hoard that you stole, do you know where it came from?
- The gold that you got, what did you do with it?
- it's possible that you should not exist depending on what you did with that gold
- The only way to end this, is to cut the source of the magic
  * wizards who uses it, wipe their memory, destroy the knowledge

### Lines
Chronomancy was never intended to exist. It was extracted from the powers of mystra during the fall of the netherese. I hoped severing the connection with them would be enough to release that energy, but the knowledge lived on.
Dragon Hoard:
- Chronomancy has non-sensical effects on the multiverse. Someone takes something from the future, and brings it to the past; that item now exists in a time loop. It must end up in the location in the future to be stolen, yet has no concrete origin. It breaks the original creation, and shoe-horns the universe into a pocket with no real history.
- Where did the gold come from? No one knows anymore, our position in the multiverse is severed from the universe where the gold had a real origin.
- Spent gold? Well, that gold has to find its way back. The universe will conspire to do so, but it becomes ever more strangely deterministic.

Paradoxical Summons: ok as long as you complete it. If you break it, you cause another paradox elsewhere.
Hans:
- One loop that started since your time on Grundsgryn, is a mage called Hans.
- The universe conspired to bring him back in time to guide you to unwind cycles, causing you to disperse the gold in locations that would eventually be hoarded by `Nihilanth`
- His wild magic makes him more susceptible to the deterministic influence of Chronomancy
- (they can maybe see Hanir and Hjarka helping Hanir cleanse himself through umberlee)
- (he jokes about it and departs, but it's not working for him, he voyages to [[moray]] to try to get Wish access, ties in with his desire to get the Wish card)
