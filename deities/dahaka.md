Ancient LG
Based on Prince of Peria; Warrior Within

Came about due to netherese society starting to tamper with time.
Dahaka desires chronomancy to unwind chronomancy for his existence to end.

## Abandoned: Chase Scene Grundsgryn
Dahaka chase into Wave summoning an Elder elemental MTOF 198

## Mordai Challenge
Mordai does not have a god/patron anymore.
But upon death, he can get a challenge to "unwind" his fate.

He needs to unwind a bunch of time loops. They will stop with the last of the 3 [[undying-soul]].

### Looks
Faded area with dahaka. He needs to cast chronomancy to align with the time. He will see one devil.
Winged devil ; black cornugon in full plate. wings probably under his armor.

- I take many forms. I simply took one that I thought would be most comfortable for you.

### Offer
Dahak will
- offer him temporary immortality for his purpose for 1 month, and at the end, he will die.
- afterwards: tie up the hanir loop triggered by mordai's chronomancy influencing the wild magic

if he declines the undercover mission (temporary immortality), hanir tieup starts immediately.

Deal:
- he gets to live for 1 month; true Divine Soul/Patron
- can cast any spell provided he has scroll; spell DC buffed to 20 somehow?
- can do a once per week full rest refresh (chronomancy refresh)
- needs to kill Arklem/Irae/Kiaransalee
- need to kill or Modify Memory Ursula (8th level)
- need to kill or Modify Memory Celerom (8th level)

## Personality
Cop interrogation. Good cop.
Deep voice.

- Tell me. When did you learn about chronomancy.
- The dragon hoard that you stole, do you know where it came from?
- The gold that you got, what did you do with it?
- it's possible that you should not exist depending on what you did with that gold
- The only way to end this, is to cut the source of the magic
  * wizards who uses it, wipe their memory, destroy the knowledge

### Lines
Chronomancy was never intended to exist. It was extracted from the powers of mystra during the fall of the netherese. I hoped severing the connection with them would be enough to release that energy, but the knowledge lived on.
Dragon Hoard:
- Chronomancy has non-sensical effects on the multiverse. Someone takes something from the future, and brings it to the past; that item now exists in a time loop. It must end up in the location in the future to be stolen, yet has no concrete origin. It breaks the original creation, and shoe-horns the universe into a pocket with no real history.
- Where did the gold come from? No one knows anymore, our position in the multiverse is severed from the universe where the gold had a real origin.
- Spent gold? Well, that gold has to find its way back. The universe will conspire to do so, but it becomes ever more strangely deterministic.

Paradoxical Summons: ok as long as you complete it. If you break it, you cause another paradox elsewhere.
Hans:
- One loop that started since your time on Grundsgryn, is a mage called Hans.
- The universe conspired to bring him back in time to guide you to unwind cycles, causing you to disperse the gold in locations that would eventually be hoarded by `Nihilanth`
- His wild magic makes him more susceptible to the deterministic influence of Chronomancy
- (they can maybe see Hanir and Hjarka helping Hanir cleanse himself through umberlee)
- (he jokes about it and departs, but it's not working for him, he voyages to [[moray]] to try to get Wish access, ties in with his desire to get the Wish card)
