# Kiaransalee
> The Wailing Banshee / The Revenancer
Vengeful scythe wielding drow. Cruel, twisted, went insane ages ago.
Lesser deity, portfolio; revenge.

Never trusted anyone else to do justice to her vision, so she settled problems for herself.

Once a mortal priestess, Kiaransalee is reputed to have returned from death driven by the power of her own spite to slay her rivals with an army of undead.

Lolth was so impressed by her spite that she exalted Kiaransalee to divinity, letting her return time and again to slay those newborn drow whose newly-woven souls smelled of her enemies - which, ultimately, must be all drow. To stave off her depredations, drow burn incense or meat in hopes of masking the scent of their newborns, their sickly, or their warriors. In this way she is also an embodiment of the Matron Mother's driven daughter, always looking for weakness and desperate to defeat her rivals.

While drow fear Kiaransalee, she is a reminder that failure comes at a cost, and that strength can be found by punishing betrayal or failure.

## History
Took over the east, and rendered it corrupted. 700 years ago. We don't know too much of her upbringing and rise to power. She was originally a priestess of lolth, but had a falling out and branched out to the eastern empire, where she

Summoned undead through the shadowfell in the acropolis in [[velddrinnsshar]] using an artifact called the voidstone. Such summoning was too powerful to go did not go unnoticed. Mages far and wide were unable to face her, but a series of divine champions eventually banded together and defeated her. Due to their power, the voidstone was used by Kiaransalee to power her scythe rendering it extremely dangerous.

NB: s/voidstone/Egg of Galadaeros/g

## Clergy
Orderly regimented cells of drow clerics (necromancers often) in enclaves. Heavy on persecution, autocratic. High ranking clerics given priestesses to deal with nay-sayers. Many were liches, many with ties to Thay.

Larynda Telenna high priestess. In Vault of Gnashing Teeth beneath Vaasa (frozen wasteland).

## Stats
If she rises: Base on CR30 https://kryptonluke.wordpress.com/2015/06/18/lady-of-pain/
Style like Queen of Blades SC2

- 25AC, Resistant Physical(Piercing/Bludgeoning/Slashing). Resistant Poison/Acid/Lightning. Immune Necrotic.
- Stuns can happen, but only take away one of her legendary actions.
- 30HP regen every round.
- TODO: Spells (some must be absorption'able)

Make a 10th level spell.
- 30AC mage armor
- Necrotise anyone she looks at / is touched by (or just use flaying glance)
- Raise Dragon
- Raise Undead Mirrors of Players (Simulacrum/Clone?)

TODO: plot hooks on how she works?
- Rising insta-necrotises something as it comes up.
- Arklem can also mention it.

Information to seed:
- They need necrotic res. (Remind them of flowers - full res for 8h)
- They need to bypass her gaze; Kavaki/Selune divine fortress? Forbiddance.
- First attacks against her do nothing. Flaying Glance once? DC26 CON vs 22d6 necro ought to be a deterrent.

Plot hooks:
- Mordai: Setup the force cannon from the acropolis it the top of Castle Never (quick heist)
- Mordai: attune to Wand of Orcus and gain crazy dmg spells (although that setup is boring for GW)
- Faey: Use Necro Flower recipe to gain an advantage
- GW: Kavaki's Simple Fortress; near GW's temple in NW to allow him to channel a special divinity within city borders
 * need something to make her vulnerable to Banish (gw can do it up to 3 times) -> Abyss
 * Auto-fail condition within fortress if mortally wounded?
 * Otherwise; lich resurrect?
 * How to seed the spell? Reskinned Mordenkainen Fortress?
- Faey/GW: tremmels in the gilgrin forge (via cloud giants?)
 * Plot justification for this? Would need lore in Acropolis.

### Boss Fight Neverwinter
How does she get there?
Teleport the acropolis, 2 days out from NW, slowly float it towards NW.
Why? Valindra is part of her. Tons of dead there to raise. Outside to avoid fortresses / trap spells.

Raise dead in the area:
- Greycloaks galore
- Zaehesh
- Flaming Fist champions
- Legion of Banshee Knights (TODO: stats?)

Environment: Near market. She's 100ft tall? They need to fly. Feels weird.

### Weaknesses
Ring finger.
All magic from silver rings?

## Legion of Vengeful Banshees
Banshee knights stationed at Acropolis of Thanatos.
Still guarding her

## Graverending
Single annual holy day of the faith. Celebrated each midwinter Eve. Each cleric travel to a nearby village outside their control and in the midst of night, raise as many undead as they can to increase their ranks.
Due to the stealthy aspect of this operation, the date varies each year.

## Resummoning
Can be resummoned in [[velddrinnsshar]] in the Acropolis.
