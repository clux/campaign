# Kiaransalee
> The Wailing Banshee / The Revenancer
Vengeful scythe wielding drow. Cruel, twisted, went insane ages ago.
Lesser deity, portfolio; revenge.

Never trusted anyone else to do justice to her vision, so she settled problems for herself.

Once a mortal priestess, Kiaransalee is reputed to have returned from death driven by the power of her own spite to slay her rivals with an army of undead.

Lolth was so impressed by her spite that she exalted Kiaransalee to divinity, letting her return time and again to slay those newborn drow whose newly-woven souls smelled of her enemies - which, ultimately, must be all drow. To stave off her depredations, drow burn incense or meat in hopes of masking the scent of their newborns, their sickly, or their warriors. In this way she is also an embodiment of the Matron Mother's driven daughter, always looking for weakness and desperate to defeat her rivals.

While drow fear Kiaransalee, she is a reminder that failure comes at a cost, and that strength can be found by punishing betrayal or failure.

## History
Took over the east, and rendered it corrupted. 700 years ago. We don't know too much of her upbringing and rise to power. She was originally a priestess of lolth, but had a falling out and branched out to the eastern empire, where she

Summoned undead through the shadowfell in the acropolis in [[velddrinnsshar]] using an artifact called the voidstone. Such summoning was too powerful to go did not go unnoticed. Mages far and wide were unable to face her, but a series of divine champions eventually banded together and defeated her. Due to their power, the voidstone was used by Kiaransalee to power her scythe rendering it extremely dangerous.

NB: s/voidstone/Egg of Galadaeros/g

## Clergy
Orderly regimented cells of drow clerics (necromancers often) in enclaves. Heavy on persecution, autocratic. High ranking clerics given priestesses to deal with nay-sayers. Many were liches, many with ties to Thay.

Larynda Telenna high priestess. In Vault of Gnashing Teeth beneath Vaasa (frozen wasteland).

## Phases
Body softly illuminate with the color of the phase. Demeanor changes in minor ways.
Players can trigger the form in certain ways if they make certain discoveries about how she works, or detect patterns in her behiavour. Some triggers are social (by speaking to her), others are mechanical (spells/objs).

Abilities happen between player turns (legendary actions).
Changes happen after current attack / spell has damage computed and ticked.
Stuns can happen to Valindra (she loses a turn).
If no changes happen in a round, take a random form at top of round.
At most 2 AOE/Gaze attacks per round (because unharmonious union).
3rd Action has to be something else.

## God Weakening
- Gaze protection vs. Larloch; Kavaki/Selune divine fortress? Forbiddance.
- Necrotic resistance (Remind them of flowers - full res for 8h)

## Plot Noticing in Acropolis
See notebooks in [[acropolis]]

Mages:
- Mordai: Setup the force cannon from the acropolis it the top of Castle Never (quick heist)
- Faey: Use Necro Flower recipe to gain an advantage
- Can't kill a god; need something to make her vulnerable to Banish (gw can do it up to 3 times) -> Abyss. Need to weaken her to near-death.

Clerics?
- GW: Kavaki's Simple Fortress; near GW's temple in NW to allow him to channel a special divinity within city borders (How to seed the spell? Reskinned Mordenkainen Fortress? Auto-fail condition within fortress if mortally wounded?)
* Clergy; turn rivers into holy water

Acropolis
 * Acropolis; soul of felgolos can be used (tear at it / use it as a focus) if they extract it
 * Acropolis; larloch's ring can be used. casts something that will trigger his phase

- Faey/GW: larloch / valindra items to help draw them out

- Party: If Irae becomes part of her, then she'll be weakened if they take care of Irae's phylactery.
- Mages; some way to cancel out regeneration? maybe Kavaki quest with spirits?


### Initial Fight in Acropolis
She rises there, but hasn't fully recovered her powers. Will use them, but will not want to risk anything. Need to exposition a bit here for intent / weaknesses. She also needs to feel powerful without actually killing them here (at least permanently).

Kill one with huge damage as they discover a weakness, target that player.

She's "above them" initially. Don't even react to attacks that do no damage.

- INITIAL MOVEMENT: **soft exhale + explore body** "not perfect, but you have done well."
- INVESTIGATE SOURCES: **flashing green** "valindra, timeless sorceress, unimaginable progress", **flashing white** "irae, grand visionary, perfecter. completer. ruthless." (twitches as the last word is said), **flashing purple** "larloch, ancient sorcerer, ancient suffering"

Kill one of them if they do damage to her (rebuke with Gaze), she'll retreat into the Orb, and teleport the orb over the material where she gains power, absorbing the light of the sky. Daylight over.

She takes damage while she's in Irae's form? White flashes. green and purple flashes indicate extreme danger.

- **Irae's form** *White*: Scythe wielder takes damage from Radiant
- **Larloch's form** *Purple*: Necrotic Gaze takes damage from force/thunder/lightning/fire
- **Valindra's form** *Green*: Raising Undead takes damage from piercing damage / bludgeoning

They need to discover a weakness here. Finger with rings / wings. Radiant weakness in one phase.

Weakness: her retribution sources are built on a contradiction (irae betrayed to larloch + valindra)=> K can be out-talked / her forms can be triggered.
Weakness: her forms can be triggered. GW can draw out Irae's form. Mordai can draw out Larloch's form? Faey can draw out Valindra's form?

### Escape
- morph scenery around her, direct route out of shadowfell. ripples in space.

VOICE! Deep inhaling breathing into mic.

#### Lines

- NOTICING THEM/INTERACTION: **soft exhale + slowly gaze towards them** white flash from her body. slow recognition, turning into disgust. "irae's nemeses" **strange twitch green/purple flash**


### Boss Fight Neverwinter
How does she get there?
Teleport the acropolis, 2 days out from NW, slowly float it towards NW.
Why? Valindra is part of her. Tons of dead there to raise. Outside to avoid fortresses / trap spells.

Raise dead in the area:
- Greycloaks galore
- Zaehesh
- Flaming Fist champions
- Legion of Banshee Knights (TODO: stats?)

Environment: Near market. She's 14ft tall. Humanoid form, just huge.

### Weaknesses
Ring finger.
All magic from silver rings?

## Legion of Vengeful Banshees
Banshee knights stationed at Acropolis of Thanatos.
Still guarding her

## Graverending
Single annual holy day of the faith. Celebrated each midwinter Eve. Each cleric travel to a nearby village outside their control and in the midst of night, raise as many undead as they can to increase their ranks.
Due to the stealthy aspect of this operation, the date varies each year.

## Resummoning
Can be resummoned in [[velddrinnsshar]] in the Acropolis.

## Misc Ideas
Make a 10th level spell?
- 30AC mage armor ?
- Crazy HP. Run her with occasional weaknesses, but just huge HP (indicate regeneration?)
- Necrotise anyone she looks at / is touched by (or just use flaying glance)
- Raise Dragon
- Raise Undead Mirrors of Players (Simulacrum/Clone?)
