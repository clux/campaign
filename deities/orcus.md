# Orcus
syrgaul + tameraut undead crew (wants to rule the seas)

## Undying Soul Attack
Attacked by [[undying-soul]] in a rapid mage attack.
Boat now floating in the sea.

Happened at sea after the Tameraut had gone down. But same place.
Irae dropped bits of herself into the ocean (it melded with magic components of the tameraut later).

That's why Irae's phylactery is portable from the Pit of Hatred.
Tameraut had magic capabilities embedded in the ship. Malfunctioning in water.

Why could they enter a portal underwater?
Entered into low water side and portal somehow does not respect pressure.

## Orcus's Ship
Watches over the seas near the rift. Will attack anyone who's been on the island to erase notices.

Huge galleon made out of bone (keratin). Figurehead is a shark skeleton that can be animated. Horns everywhere.
Comes towering out of the mist. Mistake it for a wall at first.

He can pull them in to the Island of Bones.
Need MTOF + volos.

They can escape with Lee/other magic... Otherwise it's a fucked up battle where they are captured and brought to island of bones. Arena on the island to turn people evil. Paladdin is delicious for them. Only way out is to become an oath breaker.

## Rejected
Orcus' ship being summoned for the final push via flayers.
He's now in the astral sea floating his massive destroyer. Bone ship with tentacles?
Will invade the sword coast. Rift helps open things up.
If army takes over island and starts cracking up the rift sufficiently, Orcus can pass.
Syrgaul down there undead with the rest working on it.
Ultimately Orcus' is not important here. Syrgaul could just have been powered by an GOO as well.
In which case, various nautilus ships can surface if the undead rip up the coastline.
