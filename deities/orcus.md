# Orcus
syrgaul + tameraut undead crew (wantss to rule the seas)

Orcus' ship being summoned for the final push via flayers.
He's now in the astral sea floating his massive destroyer. Bone ship with tentacles?
Will invade the sword coast. Rift helps open things up.
If army takes over island and starts cracking up the rift sufficiently, Orcus can pass.
Syrgaul down there undead with the rest working on it.
Ultimately Orcus' is not important here. Syrgaul could just have been powered by an GOO as well.
In which case, various nautilus ships can surface if the undead rip up the coastline.
