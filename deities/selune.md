"Oh, hey! Hello! Welcome to my secret lab. Secret lair? Moon Pavilion? Yes, I like that one the best."
"Uh, you're from the prime material. You smell oddly. Who let you in here?"
"Kavaki? hurgph, that brute."
"ooh, wait someone is getting married. he's a follower so he needs a wedding night blessing."
"Oh hello, Adventurers. If you wouldn't mind taking a break from smashing creatures into goopy collections of bone marrow and sadness, I have a job for you back in Argentil. This isn't a date."


"Sometimes I put my hand on the shoulder of the nearest passer-by -- which for the record aggravates my vomit reflex -- and I say Good job! Lord Garflax of the Tardik system values your sacrifice, to mess with them! And then I burn an effigy to Lord Garflax."
