# Umberlee
Lee is a tiamat strength creature, controlling an equally powerful Kraken.
She ascended through Yog (kraken is a sun of an old one).
Yog allows her to command the kraken like that as long as she helps expand the sea.

## Motivation
Wants to expand the water connection to increase her sphere of influence. Told Hjarka to place Wave under 3 distinct points of the sword coast to break apart the continent.

## Patrons
- [[hjarka]] - ascended in [[35-temple-of-the-queen]]
- old [[hanir]] is a failed cleric; Lee rejected him
