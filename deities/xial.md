# Xial

Great old one. Basically a re-skinned [Yog-Sothoth](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Yog-Sothoth)
Shrine found on the Emperor of the Waves in [[38-iz-ship]].

## Motivation
Xeal / Xeleliah works to further the flayers. It's an elder eye and an elder brain in one. It's the gate to all knowledge, and it feasts on all the elder brains in the galaxy. Only Elder brains know about it, and they will not divulge the info willingly. In the current situation, it's more beneficial to the flayers to help open rifts everywhere.

Ancient Beholder 32 eyes. Actually just a WOKE Elder Brain.
Consumed multiple beholders (including Xanathar)

## Known patrons
- [[Gwyn]]
- [[iz]]
