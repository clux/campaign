Scale down crew requirements. We can have smaller boats..

except AC + speed which both stay the same – maybe even higher..

### Crews
Captain: BL2 characters. All have problems.
- Mordecai: lost BW. Alcoholic.
- Brick: lost crew. Compensates by having fights and lashing weak minded people.

All display their behaviour quite a bit, and want to keep time on the sea get away from reality.

Brick has Large muscly barbarian captain, bandana. Deep husky voice.
