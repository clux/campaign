# Pantheon
Started out using standard 5e deities, but as need arose, a more fixed pantheon around the players stabilised.

## Core Pantheon
Gods whose presence must exist due to player relations.

- Moradin - LG greater deity - creation/protection
- [[dahaka]] - NG greater deity - time
- [[selune]] - CG greater deity - knowledge/life
- [[eilistraee]] - CG lesser deity - beauty/dance/moonlight
- [[ravenqueen]] - LN mystery deity - life/death
- [[kavaki]] - N lesser deity - simplicity
- [[xial]] - NE great old one
- [[lolth]] - CE lesser deity - drow/spiders
- [[kiaransalee]] - CE lesser deity - arcana/death/vengeance
- [[umberlee]] - CE - tempest
- Mephisto - LE - secrets/contracts

## External Gods
Generally not used, and have avoided adding temples, but may have referred to them in plot hooks that didn't work out.

- Tymora - CG (lady luck, good fortune)
- Ilmater - LG (The Broken God - martyrdom/suffering)
- Garl Glittergold  - LG (gnomeish - luck)
- Lathander - LG (The morning lord / creativity/self-perfection/vitality/yuth)
- Mystra - LG (nth incarnation - controls Magic - many famous chosen)
- Waukeen  - N (merchants friend, lady of gold - on the coins in BG)
- Ubtao - N (creator of chult, father of dinosaurs, the deceiver)
