Started in [[neverwinter]] in [[125-denouement]]

NB: Original place where Stage2 happened has formed into a unique gemstones forming after the crazy damage. (Kiaransalite beautiful radiant orange gemstone that seem to emanate a soothing white flame not warm, not cold, just soothing)
Kavastones
Kavastonites
Ramstones

## Denouements
### Diana/Ursula Chronomancy (Mordai)
(GW still in Tenser's Transformation, DC15 CON save vs exhaust)

- "That was amazing, all of you."
- "That is one colorful paladin you got." (Describe tenser's + teal 3-boob suit, burning red orcus wand).
have an awkward moment where remaining gray cloaks gather around...
maybe lead into GILBERT here...
then come back with Kiaransalite remains and scythe

- To Mordai: "I've never seen someone cast spells as fast as you did there. If this is the power of chronomancy, then, wow. I know this is soon, but at some point, when you've had some time to think. We could use teachers at the mages guild to help improve the quality of our students."

- Ursula about Staff if GW keeps it: "You know, that Wand Goatweaver is using seems a lot more powerful than I thought originally. Do you think he'll be able to handle it?"

Diana + Ursula agrees to Modify Memory 8th.
Celerom + Adalon + Sansuri
GW + Faey
(Adalon got Extinction)

### Sahaquiel Ending (Mordai)
key points:
- kiransalee can return if chronomancy still exists
- mordai must modify memory on ursula/diana/sansury/celerom
- [[dahaka]] will intercede in second half if nothing is done / after last memory wipe
- "there's only one thing left to do now mordai. it's time to forget what you know about chronomancy. time is not a circle if you do not tamper with it. you can forge your destiny without this magic, you will be a powerful sorcerer, that does not end up as a set of artifacts 500 years down the line when new liches rise. you will forget some things however. you will think you never met me, some aspects of your struggle against the chronomantic liches will seem strange to you, that's because your mind will try to make sense of minor inconsistencies in my modify memory."
- Level 17 Celestial Sorcerer when it happens - no memory of patrons/chronomancy or casting of such spells. But remembers the epic battle you had and the sheer number of fireballs you got out. It's hard to pinpoint everything that went down in those fateful minutes, but you, Goatweaver and Faeynore all got together and performed to your fullest.

Get him to eldritch blast in Graycloak camp (to highlight level 17 EB. Four white, beams of force emanates from mordai's fingers, a spectral deeva-like-head swirls around each orb as they move towards the targets. (Patronus like).

if he doesn't do this, he leaves a foot in the door for chronomancy and kiaransalee to return, but he becomes the most powerful sorcerer on the coast.
(In which case the painting commissioned will accidentally be named The Sunset Warriors)
- Dahaka warning: If you keep using Chronomancy, you are poised to become the greatest sorcerer that ever lived, but it means that when we meet again, I am unlikely to be your ally.

### Graycloak Target Practice (Party)
- dummies in gray cloak camp (compete for single target damage)
- ONE RANGED ATTACK (cantrips, one weapon, thrown, missile)
- ONE CLOSE RANGE ATTACK (spells allowed)

### Galeron Gilbert (Party)
shouts from side-street "NO DONT". Hear a crossbow bolt release. **Clank**
Rush in to see Galeron and one graycloak hiding behind pieces of wood as a crossbow bolt flies over your heads from across the streets. Hear soft broken esophagus noises, something is definitely there.
> What do you do?
- save / kill Gilbert.
If kill? Galeron will be upset, but will come around later in the episode (if they're there).
If save? Galeron thankful (even though kid will need some care).
- "oh my god, what a slaughter that was. "

(INTERJECT resurrections potential below)

- "but, still, we are alive. and you did it. boy i hope this is the last time you come to me with bad news. listen, i need some time, maybe come see me tomorrow."

### Galeron Funeral/Resurrections (Goatweaver)
- "That is a lot of dead soldiers.. so many promising cloaks."
- Find: One dried and almost solidified potato with the phrase "Kavaki protects us" carefully etched into the skin
- Find: small etched silver insignia on the bodies that you hadn't noticed before. curled ram horns on a goliath like face (not the best kavaki rendition, but you can tell it's trying to approximate something goatweaver enthusiastically described)
- "Our numbers are decimated. How will we ever recover from this"

technically, gw can res one/two per day with the wand if he'll risk it. Will trigger Wand of Orcus saves and hopefully we can lean into that.

- "We will have to hold a funeral tomorrow. Will you help?"
- (maybe they can help with a boat)

..one father comes rushing in angrily in face of the more stoic galeron
- "no, you cannot let this happen, you have the most powerful clerics and paladins right here and now, you must be able to revive them, please."
- Ursula: "it's too many. we do not have components for that type of large scale tampering with mortality."
(pm gw that he has resurrection on his staff, 3 per day, could do it in a month)
(nice moral choice for him, save hundred people, at a small cost to himself)

### Scythe Prophecy (Faey/Mordai)
Scythe on the ground. Not attunable by them.
https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2391663-scythe-of-the-revenancer
Can take it apart, but not destroy the pieces.

However prophecy of the [[undying-soul]]:
> The aligned three avenges that which came before. They shall become the true harbingers of the long peace. Through all means necessary, the errors of the past shall be corrected, and through conflict, peace will return. So sayeth the revenancer.
**This actually happened; but the aligned three were them.**

Potential future stupid quest: destroy [[orcus]] with it (highlighted in flavour text on the scythe) to forever destroy the scythe.

They immediately took it apart without identifying it :shrug:

### Galeron Watchers (Faey)
> Faey wants to expand Watchers of the Night to the material plane. "We were far too close to a vengeful god returning to the world, so the Watchers need to be there to stop it happening again".

Next day:
- Faeynore, is it. I realize that we never spoke much. But just gotta say, that was some exceptional shooting. I've never seen anyone move so fast and shoot so accurately from such distances.
- Faeynore proposal re: watchers. I know that you probably have your own place to go to, but maybe you would consider staying here. Our numbers are severly diminished, and we are not going to be able to protect or watch over anything, much less contain the undead plague from the cemetery.
- I know this probably isn't a substitute for your home, but you have the tower, you can come and go as you please.
- Isn't the faeywild all around us? Is there some version of this place that you can watch over as a watcher? That way you'll be close to us.

-> arch-faey in faeywild (variant of neverwinter || or his home)
-> potential future quests for faey and party to clear out the undead

### Arch-fey Setups (Faey)
Kids being impressed by faeynore's increasingly complex looks.

16yo
- "can you use magic?"
- "i want to go to the mages guild to learn, but i hear it takes years."

faey can probably archfey subclass someone: http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock:archfey but with a different spell list...:
- 1: minor illusion / charm person
- 2: darkness / cloud of daggers

### Galeron - Halls of Justice (Goatweaver)
He needs "reliable sources" for his judgement.
- Ursula can vouch for him (he has his heart in the right place, and he is gathering immense power as a patron of Kavaki, that much is obvious - I have no doubt that he can use his powers for good in this city)
- Gregor will absolutely not vouch for him.
- Celerom can vouch for him. He can find a solution to the most complex moral dilemma, and he has friends behind him to help him out, if he, uh, gets confused.
- Adalon can vouch for him. Someone behind a god of goliaths is not going to be a pushover. As a vengeance paladin he is a great candidate for running the punitive system. You will have no beauraucracy, and with his lifelong quest for justice, I think he's had more practice than anyone in identifying who's right or wrong.

**Let them decorate and plan out how it will run.**
Test criminal?

~~Kavaki Halls of Interstellar Justice~~
"kavki's a busy god"

Kavaki Court of Justice Eternal
~~Kavaki Halls of Justice on Earth~~
~~Kavaki Court of Justice~~

podium for GW
space for jury (to advice sentences)
eternal words of kavaki
"he knows if you've been good, kavaki's coming to the court of justice"
"it's coming home, justice's coming home"

rehabilitation program. not all criminals
court of justice eternal international
Blunt instrument of justice

### Kavaki (Goatweaver)
Maybe he can retire up there with Kavaki as his bro friend. What would they do? Go on long hikes in Gladsheim? Try to have GW help him date Selune?

This will have to be super improv...

### Wand of Orcus (Goatweaver)
Uses it?
Failures => At first - 2d8 necro damage ("i must feed")). GW can probably just start seeing this as an analogue of how Mordai uses self-dmg to cast chronomancy to rationalise it. "Another spell cast, another bit of blood flowing through and out of the muscles, nothing you feel haven't seen before. Taking damage is a natural state of spell casting, you've seen Sucy heal with Life Transference, you've seen Mordai use chronomancy, there's always some cost to high powered wizardry, and this isn't anything you'd struggle paladin heal in an instant. In fact, getting the blood flowing like this actually feels kind of good. Reminds you of those easier mauling days when the faces were at face height, and the face armor was just normal face bone armor."
Failures repeated => sees red in places he shouldn't, slow decent into madness

Ignoring it for half a session => Wand pipes in: "It is time for you to complete your end of the bargain." (hopefully they try out spells so we can roleplay the rest, try to force the resurrection scenario).

Charisma save DC30 to give it up (one time roll, can use luck, he has +15). "You have used me for your personal vengeance, our journey does not end until you have completed your side of the deal. What type of paladin would you be if you were willing to lie?"
(he makes it with 32)

If he succeeds in dropping it, then they can do what they wish with the staff and be gone with this arc. Mages are happy, but graycloaks remain dead.

WIS DC is 20 now. Goes up by 1 each cast. After that it takes HP from him (not an amount he can't deal with), and if very unlucky causes chaos effects. Long term madness described above. If he resists this, go into the more comedic failure wand scenario:

- (used to resurrect battlefield): "I swear if you're going to use me for this repeatedly, I am going to throw up."
- (on sequestring): "This will only delay the inevitable; the hand of my master holding my
stiff shaft and swinging me around."
- (if reactions): "Do not play these word games. A mace does not care about the orifice into which it is plunged." or "Do not play this game, I swing both ways." or "Do not include me in talk about your man dinglers. I must return to the blood lord to feed."
- (mechanics): plane shift me to the Black Despot in Morglon'dar, and I shall free your hand of my girth.

cliffhanger potential if he keeps it:
- highlight red sense on a kid picking up a flower (technically stealing from a house's garden, to give to mommy)
- staff throws up: "That's it! I cannot deal with your continued use. I must rest." -> red sparkling magic around the face of the mace, suddenly coalesces into this blob that's then **throw up noises** ejected all over your armor. light diminishes in the wand. and your armor gets a strong red stain.
- as the sun sets: and a new look on good and evil, you carry out your path, with the Wand of Orcus as your gavel, and the unfaltering judgement of Kavaki behind you. finally, you can focus on delivering justice to the world. sure, the wand is a little stubborn and painful sometimes, but in a way it's nice to be reminded of the mortality and limits of your body. and hey, you can stop time now, who is going to want to pick a fight over the staff with the Champion of Kavaki, the Archmage of Waterdeep; Lahevik Goatweaver.

If he does relinquish it:
- Mages award him a Potion of longevity for GW (1d6+6 years younger 90% chance).
- Galeron gets the blacksmith to create a "Golden" `Maul to the City` +0 ceremonial, +2 CHA (not actually golden, just a coating, but has Kiaransalite inserted)
- Maul to the City: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/31173422412120668/

### Funeral Ceremony (Party)
If they do not follow the wand to resurrect, and instead have to hold a funeral.
Maybe they can bring a boat.

Maybe here GW can get his rewards (to highlight that they are the protectors of the city).

### Watchers of the Prime (Faey)
sending to Isteria
"kiaransalee stopped, far too close. may need to revisit plans to expand to other planes"
expanding presence in material plane
has a base in neverwinter
eladrin bringing in
-> warlock helpers
watchers into material plane
graycloaks push back on the expeditions

## One Last Get Together (Party)
The final thing to do is prompt for one last time that the PCs get together. There is probably a suitable social occasion; the death of one, the marriage of another, a coronation of an NPC they helped or maybe even a PC taking the throne, or the big opening event for some enterprise one is opening in their retirement.
You just need to set the scene and let them see how they reminisce about their time together, the roleplay standing in for the feeling of having been with this group for so long in real life.

## Tapestry Commission
`Lenissie Whitebringer` + 2 middle aged women
"epic sized"
200ft long, 10ft tall
"golden thread"
"kick starting the economy"

## Plan
### Immediate Stage
- ~~Diana/Ursula~~
- ~~Gilbert~~
- ~~Resurrections~~ (1)
- ~~Wand of Orcus first attempts and decisions~~
- ANYTHING THEY WANT TO DO THAT DAY

### Second Stage
- ~~Galeron + Faey~~
- ~~Ceremony (very short forced one)~~
- ~~Mordai + Dahaka~~
- ~~Faey: Try to get him child.~~ (he tought grayclosks!)
- ~~Halls of Justice~~
- ~~Kavaki Bro strats~~
- EVERYONE LONG TERM WHAT THEY WANT TO DO
- One last get-together if they split up..

### Cliffhangers
Need a cliffhanger to indicate that the world is still alive and you intend to keep playing with your friends.

- GW keeping orcus staff -> blurring the line of good and evil
- Mordai keeping chronomancy -> sahaquiel loop indication (portrait or other)
- Future event in the City (Zombies rising from the graveyard)
- Faey using Irae's Eyes
- Maerimydra?

### Mordai
- Diana/Ursula chats/mind wipes
- Sahaquiel Ending
- Last knowledge
- Let him design hist future

### Faey
- Arch-faey manager route via Galeron above.
- Titania in faeywild. Arch-fey now. What does he want to do?
- Kid patron route?
- Scythe for him?

### GW
For wand, go through Gilbert and resurrections first, then either:
- if they get rid of the wand -> Mages Happy, Graycloaks dead. Longevity. Maul to the City.
- if they keep the wand -> Mages scared, Graycloaks alive. Slowly maddening GW?

NB: they can get rid of the wand in two ways (drop + sequester or plane shift it)
- Plane Shift is safest (and ultimate fallback)
- Otherwise, if they succeed, they can riff a bit on it

Then misc:
- Kavaki bro strats
- Halls of Justice

if he brings up something weird:
- farm for his pets? https://i.redd.it/ry57if0dpsf71.jpg
- private kavaki shrine? https://i.redd.it/dvji9bam8gn71.jpg

## Ideas
### Gifts
https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/joegou/20_friendly_npcs_bittersweet_last_gifts_to_pcs/

- Maul to the City
- Potion of Longevity
- Painting of the Party for Castle

## Extras

### Waterdeep
[[gregor]], they kind of saved him. it's probably best if his ending is left vague.
he's both mad and somehow thankful (but he doesn't even know where the rubies came from).
meeting the party would be weird, he's got mostly anger towards them.

### Neverwinter
Soulcage for Raffolk found? They have to go after it.
Galeron can set it up if we seed Gilbert.
