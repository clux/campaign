## History
In the battle with the [[kiaransalee]], Sunwuko and Natalya fell.

After the showdown;  Shario used high magic to erase Kiaransalee's name from everyone's mind, all the Crones either died if they were undead or were left extremely confused and lost. Akkhan hunted the remaining undead that didn't perish when Kiaransalee did.

Unable to destory the voidstone, Shario took brought it to a safe mages guild in Luskan where it now helps the Arcane brotherhood.
TODO: Effects to banish her caused the great sundering? Magic ceased to function. Shario perished?
All books about it were erased. Shario used high magic to erase her name and protect the voidstone (egg).

Waterdeep mages made a pact with the gods to get rid of her, but could not.
[[ursula]] knows about her through her great grandmother Callistis,

#### intro
Tales of miners not returning in Icewind Dale.
Downstream (Luskan / Neverwinter), out of diamonds.

### Items
- Heaven's Fury (Radiant energy d3 shotgun) helmet
Whenever hit with weapon, it hits with the power of kavaki in 3 directions
60 degree differentiation from center. Each beam carries same damage. So can in theory triple damage output. __in tomb__

- +3 Two Handed Flail 2d6 (Golden Scourge - Divine Smite bounces 10 feet to up to 3 additional creatures) - an attempt to recreate Akkhan's weapon. Needs a 5th level radiant damage spell imbued plus the soul of Akkhan / 1000gp opal. Needs 21 strength __felgolos partial recreate__

NB: Heaven's fury stacks with Golden Scourge (so can do 3x3 smite hits against AoE)

### Tomb Boss
Death Knight Akkhan: https://i.redd.it/n9kv95j532y41.jpg
Failure here can turn GW into a villain death knight?

## Sunwuko
Shrine in Sunset Mountains - South of Netheril (in ruins)
Netheril east/west border is undead territory.

Sunwuko a master monk ruled the City of Shade. They had developed a completely different style of fighting to combat the stun-proof elites of the undead; avoidance, drain, + fast shooting weaponry (auto-reload crossbows).

Worshipped the Monkey King. Incredible agility gave him great prowess in battle and dancing.

NB: Monkey King is actually CR21 on CC337 and has ape like (simians) minions.
Can put them guarding it?

TODO: have him basically have god status, and have Quin his current champion?

### Items

- spirit stone: grant Breath of Heaven spell (heal all allies within 30 ft - ~25% of monk's health)
- auto-reloading crossbow (generate ki on hits, cannot stun while equipped?)

## Kiaransalee's Resting Place
Ex-netherese Empire beneath Acropolis of Thanatos in V'elddrinnsshar.

### Mechanics
Magically imbued scythe. Egg of Galadaeros (aka the Eternal Star) compressed as the pommel (given to the Arcane Brotherhood to protect).
Iridium Blade of Shadow, buried with Shario.
Staff of Thunder and Lightning (used to belong to Umnos, but he sealed it in Gilgrin) ((perhaps make it lightning only, but higher stun DC))

Could not be charmed, could not be stunned, and could not be transformed in any way. Attacks out of nothing (invis), and when angry.

### Lore
The Crones of Thanatos was the cult dedicated to her worship. Primarily surface drow in the east. Dressed in loose black robes, gray skullcap. At least one silver ring on each hand. Faces smeared with a mix of ashes, white hourglass necklace around their neck.

Accomplished necromancers. Became Revenants, or Kiaranshee (elvish ghost type "keening spirit") - basically banshees with their wail. Cabrath Nelinderra. Undead priestess of Kiaransalee. Head priestess in the Acropolis of Thanatos.

Kiaransalee lost all her power when the hordes of her followers died in this clash (Helm Rift above the acropolis). Though the last remaining champion, Shario, distributed parts of her relics to various magocracies on the coast.

Graverending; Annual holy day of the faith. Midwinter Eve. Animated as many undead as each cleric could handle => became Vengeance Hunters and were set lose with this desire for revenge against those that ended their lives (had 24hours). The undead returned to their graves after 24h or after vengeance executed.

Held complete rule in the eastern coast of Faerun for several hundred years. Only after they started tearing down the netherese and zemnian empires that they encountered resistance (and it was only at the highest level were this was even considerable).

She saw any affront to her power as a symbol of the continued oppression from the elves against the dark elves, and were determined to use any of her slain dark elves against their enemies in undead form.

Learn about the final battle; a master monk from the city of shade, the ruler and arch-huntress of zemnia, the champion of the creator god kavaki, and shario, a master evoker from zemnia. Even with all these they had to battle hordes of undead, their wailing clerics.

After the battle, Shario herself ensured every member received a properly defended burial, and the powerful item they held protected so that they never fell into the wrong hands. (TALK ABOUT THE BURIAL CHAMBERS + ITEMS).

The staff, believed to be a staff of thunder, was in Gilgrin (the most secure, vault in the contintent), the pommel in the Luskan, the most powerful mages academy on the sword coast, and the blade of shadow in the most heavily defended blackstaff tower - at the heart of the city of splendor.
