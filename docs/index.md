# Overview
DM notes and brain organisation from a 3.5 year D&D 5e campaign.

## Setup
This repo was setup with [`foam`](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/) as a [campaign brain](https://clux.github.io/probes/post/2020-09-27-second-brain/).

The webpage is using [`mkdocs`](https://www.mkdocs.org/) with [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/).

To browse locally:

- `code`; [clone repo + install extensions](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#getting-started) to get working [markdown links](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tchayen.markdown-links)
- `hx` open with a good markdown language server (e.g. `marksman`) and jump with `goto definition`

## Organisation
Folders generally specify regions, these sometimes coincide entirely with chapters of the campaign, but often not due to the amount of quick teleports between them.
