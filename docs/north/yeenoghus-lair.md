# Yeenoghu's Lair
Forgotten Caverns U map.
Start in huge corridor. Ominos large crushing sounds, followed by 50 gnolls.
Corridor partially made by purple worm (but yeenoghu can burst through tiny openings pretty  easily)
Then silence. Chanting gnoll voice: Yeenoghu (3 times). 5 seconds of silence, then this deathly roar.
Then gradually more frequent steps, and Yeenoghu comes..

**Fight area entrance**: Cave complex 500ft underneath the Boreal Valley. Get there through a purple worm tunnel, they can retreat into soft areas a purple worm nursery. They can also hide in there if they find it early and roll decent stealth.

## Intro
Cavern opens up from the purple worm tunnel.
Different texture to the rock here, not a lot of heavy rock. Mostly clay.
However, as the cavern opens, huge iron spikes coming out of the ground. Impaled through one of them is the skull of a canine figure, picked clean, apart from one eye dangling from the socket.
Huge stomp. Small quake. Rubble falling from the ceiling.
Ceiling: It's mostly dry due to the temperature, but you see holes them, about 3ft wide circular holes.
Stomp: Sounded like it came southward.
Spikes: One is retracting.

### Reinforcements
1 Snowy owlbear on a leash. Blood splattered all over its fur.
One flind riding it.

2 gnoll pack lords
2 hunters with longbow.

- TOP ROUND: summon 10 gnolls from holes. 1 Pack Lord.
- He can teleport to the other end.
- Summon a fuckton of basic bitch gnolls from the back if things are going really well for them

#### Damage
E(Hit) = > 90% on everyone except GW (maybe less with Shield and blinks)
E(Hit|GW haste) = 50% (haste => 22AC, and passive disadv)

NO: Yee E(DMGX2DICE) = 0.9*(21*3) + 26 = 83 (awful vs people, but can pick paralyze/confusion)
Yee E(DMG) = 0.9*(15*3) + 13 = 53 (dangerous vs everyone else)
Yee E(DMG|GW) = 0.5*(15*3) + 13(extra dmg effect) = 29 (better to paralyze attempt)
Also got one bite attack legendary (x2 actions) for extra 14.
Last action: extra charge or a reaction swat. Make it a flail attack..
Put a crit in there.

Invisibility enrage. Dispel out of it
3x leg. saves. TRUESIGHT. Charm/exhaust/frighten/poison immune. cold/fire/lightning res.
Ignore damage resistance parts and just boost dmg / followers? He could do 70dmg per round.
Buff damage slightly, and save a few crits if followers die.

- Legendary resist, advantage on saves. 22 AC (describe it!). Bonus bite if he kills something (his turn only)
- Spirtual weapon flail conc!


Helpers: 2x Flinds! 127HP

### Flail
#### Detrimental Props
Rolled:

While attuned to the artifact, you emit a sour stench noticeable from up to 10 feet away.
While attuned to the artifact, you can't smell.
The artifact houses a bodiless life force that is hostile toward you. Each time you use an action to use one of the artifact's properties, there is a 50 percent chance that the life force tries to leave the artifact and enter your body. If you fail a DC 20 Charisma saving throw, it succeeds, and you become an NPC under the DM's control until the intruding life force is banished using magic such as the dispel evil and good spell.
