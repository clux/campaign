# Adalon
High Chancellor Adalon the 5th of [[icewind-dale]] and Nobilis Argentum of [[silver-helix]].

His "family" always rules, settles disputes, barbarians/goliaths somehow never attack the city. Only room for so many though, population stable for the past century. Run it like jarl's city in skyrim.
It's Adalon the 5th now. He's 1200 yo. He has vast knowledge.
Frequents the island of Gundarlun  as a dragon, but his identity on land is a secret outside org.
Has a pet raven Ei√∞r (oath)

He fought Arklem once when he tried to raise heroes of the city.

Have kept spies around Gilgrin, Menzo, Maerimydra to check for dark ones.
Will want similar updates.

## Threats
Responds with cone of paralyzing gas. DC24 CON vs 1min paralyze.

## Needs
Won't go out of his way to help, but must be asked.
Wants to be informed, and will help if needed, but not keen on conflict. Not keen on having his identity revealed (will telepathy to Hjarka)

## Lines
on demonlords: "Menzoberranzan of course suffered the greatest initial damage, with its summoning point so close."
on secrecy: "Unfortunately, the helix' presence is not completely unknown. Those that have been around since before the Sundering will have witnessed the power of dragons. Thankfully, we have an understanding with most that live to be that old, however, there are those of ill intent who uses the secrecy to undermine us."
on undermining: "Certain lords in Waterdeep convinced the open lords and the mages guild to protect against dragons and set up a near permanent dragon ward around the city, as a result, there has been little sway of their influence for almost the past two centuries, and they have the largest armies."
on dragons: "The dragons in the realm has always served as deterrants against incursions. The giants had Fryggt."
on giants: "Obviously they have been under the influence of the undying soul for some time
on dead dragons: "If Fryggt is defeated, then Luskan is in trouble, if Chorom is defeated, then Neverwinter is in trouble."

plan: "So, the company is pleasant as always, but is the Sultan ever going to convince anyone to lift a finger against the undead?"
his contribution: "I can always send a few barbarians as favours, but the stability of this arrangement requires me not to overstep reasonable boundaries. No flapping around and breathing ice from the skies."
on Luskan: "Luskan always resisted our advice. They even resisted our advice to mobilise on the gnoll threat and band together with Neverwinter. Now they might suffer the same fate."
On Liches: "Then undying ones. A few of them has been around so long they know about the helix. Efforts to find them have always resulted in failure, like they pre-empted our every move."
On Lich defeat: "But they can be defeated. One of them was greedy and tried to re-animate one of our most renowned heroes; Drizzt. He was a dear friend to me, and this provocation was not one I could resist."
On how to defeat: "Don't be fooled by their tricks. Whenever they fight, they tether themselves to magical effects that make them seem more powerful than they really are. Invulnerability globes, mind control, life tethering to other creatures. Combined with their pragmatism to get out of a bad situation makes them hard to lock down. We (him and Tasha) got lucky with a few clutch counter-spells and dispells which he didn't expect."
On impermanence: "While it likely taught them some respect, our failure to trace him back to his phylactery meant he was back later."
On Thay; "The dissolution of Thay did make things more managable."

mention his arcane grimeoire +3 spell DC.

## Hooks
### Liches
Tell about Arklem. Tell them impossible to scry, and stopped doing it due to counter-risk.
Counter-risk: learned they have tech to intercept telepathy, message, sending, and can calibrate it to targets.
Limiting encounters to when they have society on their side.
Won't know where the phylactery is, but know that he's likely hiding somewhere in the shadowfell.

Heavy spells.
Quest for Rod of Absorption?

### Kiaransalee
Had an army of undead.
She converted a 20-50 female priests from across the continent, and society failed to recognise the pattern.
They abandoned their original faith (apostasy), was rumored turned undead as punishment, but we don't know for sure what happened. We saw them turn before our eyes.

Ultimately, it formed a society as the clerics, aka the crones, were able to raise the dead with levels of intelligence not seen.

Heucuva (high int, cleric magic, potent aura to paralyze, faith boosting; fighting beyond point of death).
Banshee knights, powerful necromancers that controlled the heard.
Revenants (from graverending)

### Maerimydra
Knows that Maerimydra disappeared. A few drow escaped to Menzoberranzan, a few mercenaries heard from them that it was a massacre, the city starting floating out of the ground, then teleporting.
Talk about a drow priestess turned rogue, apparently a grudge against Lolth and her rule, and turned to the darker seldarine gods. (The ones that departed from the church of lolth; maybe mention Vhaeraun, Ghaunadaur, Eilistraee, and let them help out).

### Helix
Let them know basics. They have earned it. But maybe have them head out there? Nah, leave that for Andraste.
He won't know full details, just rough overviews.

Luskan dead, and we never succeeded in infiltrating the brotherhood. Best we could do was build on the thieves guild.
Neverwinter dead. Our influence was corrupted by liches. Chorom dead.
Waterdeep too preoccupied with their own minor trade issues, and nobles taking most of the wealth. Most unequal city on the coast apparently.
The only persuadable army atm is in Baldur's Gate.

If you want magic items, scrying, you'll want to visit the sultan directly. Extraordinary magical abilities in the plane of fire.
He can help pinpoint a lot. I can tell you the way, but I have to Geas you.
and you better have a something of value.

(note you won't willinly want to be released from it)

### Stormguard
Giants, well, they locked themselves down so solidly, I am impressed if you have made it out of there alive. Tell me, did you find any brass metal armor or brass wings?
Not the place you just infiltrate. United, they are an unstoppable force. Nothing could reasonably invade their fortress. All you can do is wait, and hope their societal structure breaks down.

### Felgolos
If they bite on the questioning. Dear friend, not the most social, impulsive (would suddenly dissappear on his own quests for months or years), but always remained loyal.
Say he had just completed his mating cycle, and wanted to take care of their eggs. He said he had worked out a deal with the giants, which offered both protection and solitude. However, once inside, he was never heard from again.
