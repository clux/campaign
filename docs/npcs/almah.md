# Almah
Old lady inspired by Celeste. Extraplanar. Very old.
she's under https://dnd5e.fandom.com/wiki/Nystul%27s_Magic_Aura so she appears non-magical.

## Initial meeting
Outside [[waterdeep]]'s shrine to umberlee where everything is strange.

Stands outside a small cottage. Dressed in green. Tufty white hair.
"You're almost there, just cross the bridge."
She'll laugh at you. Suggest that if you're scared by a couple of land sharks, this temple might be a bit too much for you.
"You should know, the temple is  a strange place. You might see things. Things you ain't ready to see."
WHY WHAT WHO
Here because she serves Umberlee, but won't say. She's a spirit.
