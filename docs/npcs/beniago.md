## Intro Luskan
"Ah, the heroes of the city. How unusually smooth of an entrance for you."
"Pardon my manners. I am Beniago – of ship Kurth."

Within the big purple pirate-like coat, you see his hand barely covering the hilt of a bejewelled saber. His chiselled face smiles at you as you see his smooth black hair with purple tips bounce elegantly. His dark red eyes, shine faintly behind his purple eye-sockets." A very flamboyant figure in such an environment.

There's a good laugh going through the inn, as he breaks the gaze, and goes; "And this, is my crew."

A bunch of ragged men and women, mostly male of human or elven descent, but a pair of staggeringly large ragged women not quite fitting the bill. 'Orena + Zanu' (actual Goliaths, but no tattoos, taken young age).

Magicals: Earring (illusion) + saber.
Human disguise does not age (he's probalby 100+)
