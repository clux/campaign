# Hergatha
Hergatha – the Storm Maiden. Personified goth version of Hjarka.
You see her in the mirror, a plane touched creature wielding a dagger.
(Hjarka is withdrawn, stubborn and proud, prone to battle).

The dual of [[hjarka]]. With lines like Badeline in Celeste.
Originally encountered in the abandoned umberlee temple.
But physically manifested in the [[mirror-temple]].

## Initial meeting below waterdeep
She'll see Hergatha for the first time in a mirror inside.
> "As you walk towards the large mirror, you see yourself approaching the mirror from the other side, but you're all gleaming with green and blue energy. You realize this isn't how mirrors work, and this isn't yourself.
> The creature mimics your every move for a few seconds, then suddenly lurches forward a foot so that it's really close to the mirror from what appears to be the other side. The mirror flashes, and for a brief second she's gone."
> But then. *DUCHHHHH* Her form instantly appears an inch in front of you in a flash. Glass blows everywhere as the mirror shatters. She then starts to run off."

You wonder what the hell happened. Original door behind them shut. New way out.
Climb up on old elven ruins.

"Hjarka, darling. Slow down."

> You see the form released from the mirror earlier sit by a fireplace next to a skeleton.
"Oh, I'm simply a concerned observer."
ARE YOU ME?
"I am part of you."
WHY SO CREEPY
"This is just what I look like, okay? Deal with it."
"Forget about it. I can't tell you what a relief it is to finally get out of your head."
"But look, I'm worried about us. We need a hobby, but this..."
"You are many things Hjarka, but you are not strong enough to be a conduit for Umberlee."
WHY?SAYS WHO?
"I know stubbornness is your strong suit, but be reasonable for once. You have no idea what you're getting into."
"You can't handle this."
"I am the pragmatic part. And I'm trying to be diplomatic here. Let's abandon this silly quest and be who we were." You're not strong enough to handle this.

## Light side Chase 1
Can't take damage, you're being chased out. Mirroring your actions. Psychic damage on touch. (Only to Hjarka! And she'll go unconscious only)
As you escape, her gaze watches over you as you leave the temple, seemingly bound by its confines.
How to make it urgent and not annoying?
Maybe you just need to get out of here.
CHASE MECHANIC: MAX 3 DASHES or EXHAUSTION. NO OPPORTUNITY ATTACKS.
https://olddungeonmaster.com/2015/01/17/dd-5e-quick-reference-chase-rules/ COMPLICATIONS TURN

Extra complications:
- Hazards: stalactites on ceiling, spikes on ground, crevice
- Cramped space: narrow passage

She moves 30ft (flight), they can dash, but half movement moving up (limit distance by forcing climbing). More damage if she manages to overtake and make a full necrotic embrace.

## Dark side Chase 2
= Not just a representation of depression and anxiety and anger. Also Fear, crucially, => lashing out.
- She shouldn't fight it.
- But dark side is scared and will be like, don't come near me. Chase boss.
- Completing chase => she's like. Fine you win. Go on without me.

## Hergatha 3x confrontation
From the Mirror Temple

Hergatha visible. She pulls away from you as you see her.

- "Sweetheart, this is exactly what I tried to warn you about."
- "You think I'm doing this?" With a smile. "That's cute."
- Spell attack1: FEAR: She pulls back once more.

second

- "You still don't get it? You gave me this body."
- "And I'm not even the only creepy thing living in that messed up head of yours." (elemental chaos, stubbornness, belief that everything can be solved with violence?)
- "Don't like what you see? What a surprise."
- "I tried to stop you. LOOK INTO THE MIRROR. ALL OF THIS IS YOURS."
- "This temple only magnifies my powers."
- "You're in control here, not me."
- Spell attack2: Suggestion: Pulls away once more.

third

- "Poor Hjarka, always so proud. All I do is watch over you, and you hate me for it."
- "You're unravelling and you know it."

WHY?ETC..

- "Like you would have listened?"
- "You never gave me a chance."

HOW I GET OUT

- "Now you want me to save you?"

WHY2? Just help.

- "Stop trying to make me feel like a monster.
- "You really want to know  I won't help? BECAUSE YOU DESERVE THIS."
- "Still think you can gain the powers of Umberlee? You're delusional."

Spell attack3: hallucinatory terrain.

## Ominous Whispering
You hear whispering backwards.

- "Sometimes. I. Don't really know. What's going on anymore. I don't.... know.. Who I am.
- I just... look in the mirror, and... don't know who I'm looking at. Or... who's looking at me.
- I... think a lot... about... where... my train of thought… is going...
- And it's not always a good place.... and that scares me...
- I don't.. like... scaring myself... I don't.... *sobbing*"


## Extra lines
- I can no more chose my thoughts than choose my name.
- The way he talked about thoughts was the way I experienced them – not as a choice but as a destiny. Not a catalogue of my consciousness, but a refutation of it.
- When I was little, I used to tell Mom about my invasives, and she would always say "just don't think about that stuff." But X got it. You can't choose. That's the problem.

## Rejected: Fuel onto Mordecai's depression
She'll be present in mirror filled areas later on to fill with doubt, or try to poison the minds of someone already doubting. Mordecai?

## Rejected: Materialisation Foreshadowing
She'll appear during conversation only to her. Floating in the air.

"I'm wondering the same thing. It's time to give up and go home." <- if she's actually thinking about it...
Her spirit fades in a flash and consumes a nearby torch(white flame). Out comes a MONSTER.
It chomps on you. Either initiative or wake up...

(Don't use the storm lord, save that for later...)
Maybe use Theullai: https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/monsters-by-type/elementals/thuellai-3pp/
