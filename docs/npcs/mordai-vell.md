# Mordai Vell
Rich noble warlock in [[neverwinter]] using the Graycloaks as his personal army for money. Warlock whose patron is [[koth]]. Uses the shadowfell's influence to summon undead and can be in good contact with [[koth]] as such.
Killed [[goatweaver]] once.
**DISEASED**

The patron Mindgorger has made Mordai a powerful player in battle for power in the sword coast. He thinks he's being careful. He's being used by the Aboleth. Ultimately connected to the Lich.

## Development
- [[51-cloaks-and-pugs]] Initial audience with suspicion.
- [[52-orphans-and-cages]] Necromancy spotted, subsequent confrontation (GW goes down)
- [[53-wish-unleashed]] Wish used, GW up, [[koth]] summoned, but he is destroyed.

## Lines
- "It is ultimately irrelevant. Your friend is dead. Quite powerful magic he possesses as well."
- "You are certainly a lot more than I expected. How did you come to possess such power?"

## Post GW Kill
Gloating
He comes down after healing. Dragging GW's corpse. Doing the same thing, but more confidently. (clings onto whelm even in death).
Maybe speculate on raising him as an undead so he can feed him to Koth. Ultimately just a scare. Threaten about raise dead > hostage situation.

## Contingency: Aboleth
Takes Whelm, powers it up to level two. Channels its power as a focus for "plot amount of time".
If it fails and he dies, the Aboleth appears, forming around the maul.

There, I need not hide out here covered by guards. WIth this, he is sure to complete. Koth M'gog. Consume this offering! Raise me, and my servitude will continue.


## Contingency: Force Cage
If he's attacked earlier than he expects.. Force cage around self, ideally around him and GW.
Then...
"Well, well, well. You certainly have caused a lot of problems for me. No matter. My master's incantations are almost complete, I just need a few more powerful items to sacrifice."
"But first. Let's end the formalities, shall we." Stabs him, twists the knife. A couple of words escape the lips of GW; "put him on the spot".
Takes the blood, infuses into the hammer. Starts casting a ritual spell on the Whelm. Takes 10 minutes.  (defeaning around force cage inside if interrupting) - lots of lightning injected into Whelm.

"Did I mention you are in a very special room?"  Room keeps raising enemies.

## Fallback contingency
"You cannot kill me, I am bound to Koth." Amulet shatters, flesh launched outwards. Floating skull left. All items drop to the floor."

No matter what you do, Irae will come for you. Koth will come for you. You may have stopped Orcus at sea, but The Dark Prince will impale then reanimate your decaying corpses alive in a brothel for the undead."

## Diary
How he took over the city. Bought his way in, killed the king. Deceived Chorom to aim him, always looking ahead for threats. Sends messages to Irae who's currently underneath the High Ice. (Eastern style is in Aranuouch –rework netherese crater)

He has informed Irae of events. Traces of information. "Bad news on the sea front. Syrgaul has failed to summon Orcus, and warding suggests your phylactery has been breached."

## Saved information
Map of regions drawings. Green cricles. Crude illustration of where Demogorgon (two headed baboon) + Baphomet (scary but crude goat face) + Yenaghu (gnoll) + Orcus (skull face + wings), big red cross in ocean (ditto for Juiblex). Face covered in Mushrooms spread across

Only minor setbacks to the plan. The adventurers may have stopped Juiblex' summoning, but there's plenty to consume for Koth down below.

## Manor
MV will reveal shadow door if pressed. Oil painting of tentacles. Liquid moves, eyes follow you.
Will pay you to not to kill it. He wants the zombies contained so his powers are maximized. That's why they're just sealing things off..

Rituals to talk to the Mind Gorger. Well will want to summon undead to protect himself.
Claudia will want to attack into him.
Shadow of Moil + Armor of Agathys + Huge Summon.
Summon is a Mallqui (nerfed, less spells – converted from Claudia?)
Then Eldritch blast and take it easy. Maybe FLY using one of the Arcanums.
Synaptic Static if things are hard.
Use luck to maintain concentration.
Maddening Darkness + ForceCage as well good.
If too hard. Kill one, then Soul Cage the creature and Dimension Door out.
It's probably better to fight him with support from the Graycloaks and Galeron.

## Received messages
Good news below. The gate from Morglon 'Dar holds. The Prince of Demons is unleashed. Smaller outposts have succumbed to his rule by presence alone, others will fall by force.
Bad news:
Minor setbacks in Blingdenstone. Party of 5 hamper Juiblex' summoning. Area later razed by Demogorgon, no survivors.

Illiscript sylinder: Same reading procedure as Warlock dream. Dangerous, see through visions.
Irae T'sarran: Granted undead powers by ancient writings from Vlaakith. Irae is in the acropolis of Vanathos, and building an army. Area east of mirabar has been slowly taken over as some demon lords have escaped.
Orcus stopped in the ocean ultimately.

Green dragon actually working with the Giants but uses kobolds as base of operation.
Green dragon is just crazy beefy and mad with power at this point. It will want to undercover deceive, but can do this later.

The Giants have one of three major summoning circles that keep the protection magic on the demon lords. One is in the fortress of the giants, one in Menzoberranzen, one underneath the High Ice not far from the Acropolis. End the circles, a well structured party can theoretically defeat them.

## Loot
- Big potions. Potion of Speed. Yellow fluid w black streaks. Potion of Vitality. Crimson, pulses with dull light (heartbeat). Potion of Necrotic Resistance.
