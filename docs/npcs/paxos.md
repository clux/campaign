# Paxos
Original patron of [[mordai]].

Patron guides the user into increasingly evil actions.
Patron is a slightly morally dubious fiend (arcanaloth).

## Developments
- initially; tried to guide mordai to Gulthias tree - wanted the fruit
- 30 first episodes failed to confusingly send visions to mordai (bottom of his profile)
- [[36-grundsgryn]] tried to guide mordai to the chronomancy book
- [[37-day-of-the-androsphinx]] Mordai does not give it up and takes it for himself
- No more new powers from Paxos after that (Mordai levels Sorcerer)

## Desires
Knowledge. Is one of the higher up wizards in the tower arcane in [[gehenna]].
Will need time to research book before he can relinquish everything.

## Lines
Bah. I cannot help you if you will not heed my advice. (Kruthik feeding, raiding hell).
There's only so direct I can be with telepathy (Sending)

## Rejected
### Pact of Tome idea
A leathery black book, with the close-up of a tigerâ€™s face embossed into the front.
2 feline eyes follow you as you move the book around.
