## The Black Doctor
Steam powered 10m long metal boat. Has a steering room, and an engine room.
Engine missing. He has it.
Rotor, axle into engine, connects to metal sylinder.

Engine needs steam, but also a bit of magic (phantom steed) in a pocket plane drives it.
Steam is to keep the creature on the run.

### Shadowfell Travel
Pirates of the caribbean style.
Certain point in the lake, Arcanist's Magic Aura. Turn the rotor 90deg down, reverse phantom steed.

Boat begins to rotate (keel over backwards). It's being pulled under by the engine.
When it's under, you need to prestidigitation the water away.
You then see the green acid lake below.

### Last Travel
Vampire 70 years ago. Captured by helix and interrogated, then killed. They've kept an eye on him ever since. He's been pretty suspicious and content with his life, and has not travelled since.
