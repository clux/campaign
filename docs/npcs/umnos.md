## Links

- Simulation below

## Look
(No larger than a regular giant.)
Huge bulging blue muscles and black energy swirling inside of him. large golden cumberbud (belt).
Blue light emits from his jaw, eyes, and it crackles from his hair (huge, windswept, crazy, even eyebrows and beard follows this style). Very Zeusy.

Blue light emits from his jaw, eyes, and it crackles from his hair (huge, windswept, crazy, even eyebrows and beard follows this). Shoes up to his knees and as large as a party member. Search for it. Very Zeusy.

## Lines
She told me there would sacrifices to come.
But I did not think you'd try to hunt down and kill my family to get to me.
Well, now you are here. Show me what you got.

Responses;
- a little late for that, the blade hungers
- some alliances are inevitable; i do not wish to spend a millenium ruling in silence. my name must be known, so i can be granted access to ysgard (points to tree). soon, they will have to listen.

(Ok with world burning, mind affecting)

## Motivation
Allied with Irae. Sword now in a perfect symbiotic relationship with him. Irae has infused the sword with properties akin to Blackrazor. Been around since the time of Kiaransalee, so he is infused with the powers of them.

## Stats
LVL 18 GIANT BARBARIAN RIDING A AN ANCIENT WHITE DRAGONG.
Fryggt.

Bless them with fear immunity before / Heroes' Feast. (avoid frightful presence). Identify everything.
Cold resistance somehow?

### Items
- Belt of Giantkind: +2 CON. Advantage on intimadation checks. Resistance against lightning and fire damage.
- Blackrazor: 2d6 necro +13 LG (2 attacks)

### Core stats
Damage is LG 2d6 and bonus is necro +13. Crits are 5d6 + 13.
Weapon modified to allow Thunderwave cast at will at 2nd level as leg action (as item, it'll be as part of an attack swipe).
Cold resistance. LG/Thunder immunity. Initiative adv.
Chance to come back many times. Relentless Rage DC10 +5n.
Str checks never less than 30 (indomitable might).
If enemy backs off, he can parry shots with weapon when dodging.

## Spire Battle
See stages in [[halos-3]]
### Stage 1
Attacks split between Fryggt and Umnos. FU.
Mounted combatant: adv against unmounted. Can force attacks to target mount rather than you (homebrew, ignore the dex benefit).
Otherwise will simply ride the dragon, take off when lightning is full and breathe down.

Legendary action:
- Sentinel attack if dragon targetted in melee.

Swipe around once breath and swype before landing.

### Stage 2
Off dragon, kill it to absorb temp hp in one round. => 300hp
Big fucking deal. Energy funneling off dragon, leaving it a stripped carcass. Takes a round.
=> Advantage on all checks.

Legendary actions:
- rage (+4 necro dmg) - ignore resistance, reckless (adv to hit)
- Storm aura (20ft, WIS save DC21 vs d6 lg dmg)
- Sentinel; opportunity speed disable (provoke opportunity even if disengaging)

Haste as enrage; 3 attacks.


## Dropped
### Umnos mindcontrol
Feeblemind?.. can be ended by greater restoration..
Dominate Monster at 9th level lasts up to 8 hours... she is just better at it..
Umnos in non-dominated is a previous champion of Auril, but does not need her anymore, he is as close to his own godhood as is possible.
He is CG normally. Enjoys the worship of all the Giants as Annam's presence has subsided. Wants to be the next Kavaki.

Can Irae really dominate a demi-god? Yes.
Divine boon to party if they save him +1 STR up to 20.

ALTERNATIVELY; he's crucified and about to ascend to become a death knight giant - he'll fly around in spectral form while his body is hung (they need to cast something to cancel it)

lines when freed (deep husky voice):
- "disease"
- "free"
- "not enemies" (holding back attack)
- "spell...fading...loosing hold...of my mind"
- "yeees. (backwards drawl pulling in air) i am back. thank the heavens."
- "you "

### Fracto; AC21
+18 to hit. 2d6+13 (or 16 rage) base LG, bonus necro (ignoring re-roll, likely disadv against GW), crits 5d6 LG base.
=> 20 per hit with lg res and rage
2 attack. Sentinel while riding.
LOTS OF HP IF HE CONSUMES FRYGGT 257+(162..504)
Leg 1: Riposte reaction attack. Add superiority dice to dmg.
Leg 1: Sweeping strike; hit both within reach, but LG dmg on bonus
Leg 1: Thunderwave arc 15 foot cone 3d8 thunder on CON save 20
Leg 2: Lightning lift; STR contest on HIT. Fail => extra leg action, lift SHOOT. 8d6 LG + 16 NECRO (44 with res). Then they are prone.
Leg 1: Pushing attack; 15ft on STR save fail DC24 - 2d8 bludgeoning.

MAKE ATTACKS COOL AND WIDE.
JUMP INTO COMBAT.
Special attacks; Call chain lightning. Weapon to heavens. (full action)

Always do 2 leg actions; (even if slowed => 4 attacks pr)
Haste cancels out slow except for one less leg action.
Crit once every other round. => one out of 8 hits does: 36 (26 with lg res)
If enemy backs off, he can parry shots with weapon when dodging.

E(DMG) = 20*3+26 + 2*20 + 15 + 10 = 151
(3 attcks, 1 crit, 2 sweep/riposte +thwave +push)
E_haste(DMG) = 20*5 +26 + 2*20 + 15 + 10 = 191
(5 attacks, 1 crit, same 4 leg actions)

### Fryggt; AC20
+14 to hit.
1x Bite 15ft 2d10+8 pierce + 2d8 cold = 23 (with res)
2x Claw 10ft: 2d6+8 slashing = 16
(Leg 1) Tail: 2d8+8 bludgeoning = 18
(Leg 1) Detect (perception check)
(Leg 2) Wing+FLY: 15ft radius DC22 DEX save vs 2d6+8 bludgioning or PRONE.
Breath; recharge 5/6; 90ft cone DC22 CON vs 16d8 cold dmg. Half on success.
Pointless fear (do it at start, onions and garlic).
NOTE: 72 two one or TWO creatures (hiffee) on breath
USE BREATH OFTEN. IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE RESIST.

(EXPECT TO BE SLOWED)
=> 1 less claw, 1 less leg action => -(2d8+8 +2d6+8 bonus), -2AC
=> DEX SAVE DISADV.

=> E(DMG) = 128 slowed melee, 196 unslowed melee
NB: More if breath hits more than one. Otherwise breath is roughtly equal.
Breath worse if they CON SAVE 22.
Breath on 3x is about the same as unslowed melee.


### Hiffee - Valkyrie; 19AC
+7 Longbow 1d7+7 dmg two attacks (23 per round on hit, 15 after AC)
Healing touch; 20 healing on point, plus cure things.

=> E(DMG) = 30 (if not buffing or healing)

### Goatweaver; 22AC
Hasted => 22AC, 3 attacks. 30 STR.
Will mostly hit. 2d6+11 +d8 radiant => 60 per round
Smite pool; l1x4: 2d8, l2x3: 3d8, l3x3: 3d8, l4x1; 4d8
Holy Weapon: +2d8
AVG: SMITE: +2d8
100 DMG WHEN CRITTING if failing CON20 (1/3 on fracto)
Healing pool; 116 HP + 70 HP lay on hands + 10d4+20 Supreme + 8d4+8 superior

holy weapon for one round (likely max last two conc) => 3x2d8*2 dmg
=> E(DMG) = 60*2+50 = 200
(but decreasing after holy weap)
=> E_late(DMG) = 150

### Faey; 21 AC
Hasted => 21 AC, 3 attacks
bow: 1d8+13 => 54 pr (then half of arrow slaying; 3d10) (10d8 stormbow)
sneak: d6 pr => 4
stinger => 1d8+13 +d6 frostjade (x3 w haste) => 66pr
unarmed => 1d8+7 (x2 on bonus) => 24pr

=> E(DMG) = 121 ranged + 50 LIGHTNING / 184 melee
Pretty consistent dmg when not healing
Stun CON 17. Slow WIS 17.
Healing pool; Supreme; x2 10d4+20, AOE 8d8

### Mordai; AC 17 (23 SHIELD)

Beacon Max => 60 on supreme, 68 on superior, 37 on 4th CW.

EB: 2/3 beams hit for 11 each
=> E(DMG) = 56 LG + 32 EB + 36 FB = 124
=> E_late(DMG) = 3*32 = 96

### DEUS EX: Sansuri
Smiling one. Take focus for a turn or two.


### ROUGH CALCULATION;
Party; can maybe do 500dmg in 2 rounds, but reliably 300
Rider combo; with dragon, expect 200 in two rounds (if we let umnos attack)
Umnos solo: 75 pr. 100 hasted.


Dragon can go down in 2/3 rounds. At which point 300dmg dealt.
Try to limit Umnos to 100 per round. TODO: maybe scale weapon to have some LG.

Party has: 300 HP. Can heal about 100 per round at the cost of not damaging.

Math;
Average; 250+300+300 dmg needed. (3 rounds)
Hard: 250+500+500 (5 rounds)

in 5 rounds;
- 2 rounds: rider combo has done 200 (then died)
- (none round: dragon drained and umnos raging (one extra if they are weak)
- 2-4 rounds: umnos has lost his temp hp (at least 3 on hard) 150-300dmg
- 2 rounds; umnos on last hp, raging 200dmg

1 round sacrifice on sansuri?
1 round sacrifice on hiffee? (breath on her early)

up to 700 dmg taken by party. They have 300 + can heal 133 each => 700
They need to do some lockdown and magic to do well. Mordai has control magic, they have crit potential.
