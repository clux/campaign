# Ursula
Grey/blue haired robed clumsy woman with glasses. (abjuration / illusion + lore)

https://skrtttt-6.tumblr.com/post/182928710003

Needs lore of unknown schools of magic found in the world.
Gain ranks by quests.

NB: Has the elusive ring (use damage resistance on reaction).

- Research: Found Shario's blade of shadow is hidden away in the safe of pigerion at the spire of castle waterdeep

Callistis was her great grand mother. Her memoirs mention the burial of Shario, and the sealing of her tomb.

## Post-Irae
Ursula has been scrying worriedly at Neverwinter. Sees events happening. Baphomet near Neverwinter. Yeenoghu has hit Luskan.

Trade routes rough. Gem prices already up 4x after mines cut off. Last shipment from Neverwinter yesterday expected to be the last. Food supplies still okay. Fisheries doing well, trade ships repurposed as fishing vessels.

## On Good and Evil
She can go on this whole thing about Good and Evil. "Good and Evil? Hah. After all you've been through. Good and evil are allegiances, and labels. They may reflect certain actions from the past of a creature, but trust me, you cannot use it to predict how someone will behave. We had this infernal child orphaned from some horrible parents that joined the mages guild. We used detect good and evil on her periodically, and she was actually evil. 3 years old. Can you believe that? How can a 3 year old be evil?"
Anyway, what I am saying is, you, have a strong moral compass, and a connection with a deity. Nothing that someone tells you will be able to sway that.
