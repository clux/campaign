# Virgil
Profane seagull from [[firewatch-island]].
Wants prime seafood from [[devils-reef]] before imparting with information about the [[trench-of-darkness]]

## Backstory
Familiar of Orolan. Soft scotsmans voice, lacking some syntax.

Aye been scout for Orolan, for years I have, undercover you might say. He was a beautiful man. Quiet, fed me all the nicest guts. But Orolan gone now. Dead. Killed by pirates. His few remaining friends do not seem to know about me. There's no guts be found. Apart from the filthy human corpses that get dragged down to sea every other day.

Tired of living this life. When only humans can understand me, and humans need a spell to talk to do so, then I am left with the barbaric gulls most of the time.

(Gullfriend Nancy. Fine one. Not too loud, eats anything. She's not terrible in the nest either. Stable legs, very easy for me to balance on top of her, lets me do her right up her cloaca. You probably wouldn't understand).

Neothelid guts or clearing Tammeraut grants loyalty.. Can become familiar.
