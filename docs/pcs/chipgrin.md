One shot character Spike whose character conveniently went mad and ran away for one session and he came back with this guy in a west-country accent.

## Origin
Normally an NPC in out-of-the-abyss, but Spike was happy to play the part of the conflict for fun.
See [[diggermattocks]] for goldwisker negotiation.

## Developments
- [[15-battle-for-blingdenstone]] formed a temporary allegiance
- hinted at backstab by diggermattocks on goldwiskers afterwards
