# Windsorrow
https://www.dndbeyond.com/profile/SpikeThinksYourAuthIsShit/characters/3767262

Kind of crazy wood elf monk who's they found in [[06-oozing-temple]]. Had lots of faux-zen doomer quips. Fought with them all the way out of the underdark and through the and helped defeating `Mammon` in [[30-mammond]] and with his rhyming skills helped defeat captain `Rottingham` in [[31-story-of-kenny]]. He never stepped aboard any islands in the sea, so we don't know where he ended up (we left that open-ended for a long while in case he had time to return).

## Motivation
- learning from ancient monk: learn extra rites from: https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-KzLtPs0YuPYX41g_9jL

See character sheet.

TL;DR:
- raised by monks
- found half-elf Maria, and gnome alchemist

- Maria, surprisingly became pregnant. Windsorrow was akward around this infant
- co-raising infant while alternating to adventure
- Maria didn't return at some point

- No luck
- Joined minor battle against drow on side of some dwarves
- Returns to monastery; child grown up and had left
- WS returns to underdark
