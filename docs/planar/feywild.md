# Feywild

Mostly concerning [[faey]]'s home `Mithrendain`.

## General features
- Talking horses / unicorns?
- Playful fey.
- Korred?

Crystal topped mountains spire (instead of volcano), everlansting forests. Rainforesty, but more open. Thick entwined vines growing in strange directions forming a cohesive web of a forest.
Deep shadows. Twilight skies.
Unkempt chaos magic. Echoes of past events, past creatures. Time dilation (1 day => 1 year outside).

Savage tooth + claw wilderness suffused with magic.
Floating cities with perfect walkways connecting them.

Silver-trunked trees with phosphorescent lichen. Trees merge with the landscape.
White elves, silver grey deer, black squirrel, saphira dragonflies.
Star elves, master of song magic.

Cities that merge with forests. Beautiful, pristine spires with walkways high up.

No roads, no industry, no wagons, no big amount of trade (artesian only), no mining.
Feydark (underdark) - contains the Femorians (magic giants, corrupted by power/arrogance) twisted look. Got good weapons, but they are more magical than powerful.

## History
Mystra doesn't reign supreme.
No limits to magic here. Less isolated after the spell-plague.

Eladrin can wield enormous powers here.
Creator race; leshay (eladrins); immortal (to aging/disease). Tall thin, dark deep black eyes, white skin.

> Can charm by looking at somone, creates things by thought. Teleport/breathe underwater. Can cause trees to move by looking. Still, primarily defensive. Don't seek celebrity/renown. Have seen everything before; uprisings/wars. Created the elven race.

> **Archfey**: self-proclaimed deities. Transcendental creatures. Have great powers, thousands of years old. Granted divine abilities by their worshippers. About to become gods. Can also provide a fey-pact.

- Ralketh of the infinite branches
- La Rue the unicorn queen
- Verinistra the oak princess
- Seruna Elene the nixie queen
- Nephion the lord of bats https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Neifion

Primordials may sleep in the feywild (huge mountain like creatures that may be part of the landscape).

## Feeling
Crystal wine. Abundant food. Illusionary magic. Sway the mind, lull the senses. Everything is a distraction. Hallucinogens in foods (in everything) that affect prime material people more.

Noble eladrin wonders around with various cavorting creatures playing musical pipes and instruments, timpani mini drums.

Creatures; nymphs, pixies. They think of prime material people as drow business men. Take time to smell the roses. Vent your emotions. Trip you up, so you land face first into a beehive (your face will heal, but the experience will last you a lifetime).

Riot of mischiefness, tomfoolery. Ageless , ever-present mood. Curiosity. Taken on many an adventure from these creature who have all the time in the world. Sun never sets.

### Staying too long
You become weary of adventure/conversation/wonder.

How long have you been here?
What was your purpose in the first place?

...everyone's unrelenting in their enthusiasm/revelry/drinking.

Too much for a prime material creature.
Magical energies of the place, much closer to the surface.
Easy for material spellcasters to fuck up.

Close forest paths overgrown with huge ping flowers.

## Portals
Mushroom circles, toadstools. Ever present portals to feywild. Ditto for areas of pristine beauty.
It is a mirror realm.


## Mithrendain
Eladrin Hotel / Storm Giant Protectorate.
They ate and had a merry time there.
Citadel between Feydark to protect against the Fomorians (Giants).
It's actually situated right above Storm guard Citadel (in prime material plane).
But beautiful fortress where the mountain giants resided, and their area

Creatures feel very charismatic to them (all charisma checks at disadvantage).
They will try to convince them to have fun.

### The Watchers
 The Watchers, who can ignore the city’s magic wards that prevent creatures from turning invisible, remain vigilant for signs of infiltration by the fomorians and their agents— subterranean menaces searching for the means to break through Mithrendain’s defenses and reopen the great passage into the Feydark.
Watchers can be Elf, Enchanters+Deathsworn; CC143

Leader;  ???

### Can climb down
Through a spiraling tree that mirrors the spine.
### Feydark / Gilgrin
Contains fomorians + that alternative demon lord.
Gate (below)
Where fire giant  wall was.
Inside; instead of a lava lake, black shiny liquid (toxic) that flows with low viscosity.
Elophar CC149 + Camazotz (TOB bat demon lord CR22)
Populated by Haunted Giant (CC183)
In vault: Mountain Giant CR21 in CC185

Fire giant == feydark with giants.

Frost giants == path up along side. Beautiful rivers and paved walkways where the bricks have right angles as the follow the way up. Silver trees.  Group of cavorting elves playing instruments, pixies.

At the edge of there is the bat king. He will offer them an audience with the council and berchta. But it's a fey promise. They have to help vanquish the bat demon lord stirring below if so.


### Friend of Fey
Storm giant plataeu == where they wake up. Overlook (where trap is in prime mat).
Greeted by Dayeoros. Autumn eladrin.

Comes punching him in the face (as a joke).
If fight breaks out (fey creatures easy to join in, to try to aim their hands out of harms way to cause explosions elsewhere)
