## Hook
Paxos dies in the future from Dahaka. He should not have learned its secrets.
He did not sense danger then because nothing had been subverted.

Will want the book in present now that he can sense it, but he can sense some danger around them?
They have subverted the timeline. The Dahaka is onto them.

Probably too plot sense. Just have the Dahaka show up near them, and he'll pull them all into Gehanna.
Dark mist suddenly emanates from behind you, it clashes into you like a sandstorm. Hear metal hoofs and see tendrils shooting towards you.

## Chamba
Constant magma flows. Soft grey ash falls everywhere, deadly snow, low visibility sometimes.
On top is an artificially flat ledge with Bastion of Hate.
Small tower top right. Thraotor.
Super steep mount otherwise, sharp angles below.
Side floats Nimicri small food ball?
Bottom is: The palace of Deception, Rictus, and The tower of the Arcanaloths. Aka the Tower Arcane.
The latter is probably where they need to be.

Creatures:
- Arcanophage CR4 CC42
- Rust Monsters

### Bastion of Hate
Realm of dead gods Lyachtu Xvim.
Former god of tyranny, hatred, fear. Destroyed by Bane during his return. (Bane worked with Bhall and Myrkul)

Then became an illithid colony, then destroyed by Githyanki.
But curse left behind.
Now all that's left is Zombified Gith + Zombified Giant Gith.
Dark souls style corruption. But instead of black tendrils growing out of them it's purple corruption; a virus booby trapped in Ulitharid/brain.

Music; Psyclopean Mythos Mix - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XkWKMQSYjTA

Place contains an Adamantine Citadel as parts of it (originallly sent by Menyar).
(Creatures generally avoid it).
First they need to see some shit, and walk across a bridge to get to the citadel?

**Githzerai Enlightened** MTOF 208
Serves Zaerith "Menyar-Ag"-Gith. Knows about  Zerthimon old leader who rebelled against queel Vlaakith. Receives commands from Menyar-ag still. Stays there to ensure the illithid presence does not get out of hand. Tries to bait further Githyanki to this place by keeping their presence there. At this point they're also a little too strong to deal with. They use their citadel to feed on the corrupted Githyanki? But then what about the Dahaka and time amgic? TODO:

Looks at them respectfully like a gorilla.
Talks rough, slightly ozzie/british.
- "De zara, champions." (honor to; sometimes De zara Menyar)
- "The enslavers roam this bastion, and what a fitting punishment."
- "Many of us lost our minds, after the oppression from brain eaters, but not us."
- "Zerthimon freed us from the vicious cycle. However, many of us are unable to see this point of view."
- "Now they do not see...(anything). *long inhale, smile*
- (Doomed to walk this land to fuel the ????)
- "You can see. Time is on your side. Do not waste it with rash action."

Food supply behind; Hydroponic garden + larvae farm.

**Antagonist Pontiff Xamodas**
Corrupted Githyanki Giant. Counterspell at will. Haste at start.
Half HP: summon apparition (copy of self with half HP) - plus both grow wings.
Enrage: fireball at ground when launching down..
Attacks: two huge blades. One fire, one necrotic. AOE Swipe 20 dmg, but two per round. Sometimes only a single swipe but more powerful.
Sometimes a single lunge with fire sword 60dmg (fulll round)

Loot
- An actual artifact. ROLL!
- Lava power source that fuels corruption magic that unleashed the Dahaka?

### Trhaotor
Home of Azu-Dahaka. CR14? 3 headed dragon. Dahaka spinoff?

### Nimicri
Moon. 2000ft diameter. Clean, friendly inhabitants. Giant mimic copying a city. Everyone there is a copy.

### Tower Arcane
Rises above the lavaflows, huge spikes on all angles (promising pain and death).
Record vault for yugoloths.
Huge ass library in the center extending for miles, 100m tall stacked shelves.
Circular light housey thing in the middle. Panopticon?
Books written in blood of flayed petitioners.
Houses [[paxos]].

Troops:
Allip MTOF 116 en guard (max 3 due to poteential DC14 chain stun 1/6 recharge)

Torture periphinalea line any walls not given over to bookshelves and sealed archives.
Deep below lie a vast library of contracts with mortals, extending for miles.
Protected by most potent spells in wizards' arsenal protect the sanctity of the library from encroachment by molten rock or extraplanar thieves.
Contracts are inscribed on the living skin of the petitioner burned in with magic/branding irons.
Petitioners are strung on chains like popcorn on a string for miles in parallel lines of agony.

## Mungoth
Ice covered rocky peaks, no climbing. Deadly snow/acid combo. Artificial structures provides some protection.

### Valley of the Outcast
Provides some protection. Burning Huge fortifications rising up (like a city on a hill oblivion style).
Castle with outcast fire giant wizard Tastuo? 8 fire giant siblings.

### The Frigid Palace
Maybe they can go there to solve a quest?

### EBA: Lothric style One-shot?
Why go there? That think looks like an experiment from the Bastion of Hate. It should be bound by our plane, but if it is targetting you, it can get to you. How did they make it?

From Lothric. Large castle with mages familiar with lightning magic. They have tamed dragons. What kind? Could have a very simplified dark souls plot. Fire and creatures fighting over it. But really just guards for the princes.
Rest here is just some notes on battles that could be cool + some notes on what they say in the game.

**Dragonslayer Armor**
Wields Dragonslayer Greataxe (arcs with lightning, looks like it's made out of volcanic rock) and huge shield covers most of his body. Jumps into the air with a huge swipe (DEX SAVE).
Dex saves nicer because there's a reason for them to get advantage.
AC25 unless attacking from behind. Also after the massive Swipe you can hit him for a round (AC16).
Sometimes he bonus action slams a combo (for further distance).
Reaction side-swipe. If they use their action DODGING they're likely fine (he has double disadv).
Enrage: projectiles raining down from bridge.
Backstory: Remembers the last sporting hunts shared. Something animates it? What?
Tactic meta info: Dodge, don't get hit. These creatures residing therein are huge.

**Dancer**
Initial phase (super hefty all-in stab with huge dagger/scimitar bent-weirdly)
Whirlwhindy spectral creature with two swords (enrage phase). Fire AOE after spin.

**Prince Lothric + Lorian**
"Prince lothric is in your hands. Please save his soul. Tell him what he must be. A lord..." Woman crawling over the floor.
Lorian Greatsword (on fire)
(throne: "Prince Lothric: Last hope of his line" engraved)
Phase one. Instantly misty steps on top of you as you step through the phase door. Huge slash.
Crawls along the ground and swipes in huge AOE.
" You remain among the accursed"

One of them casts magic missle? on all of you, dodgeable from a distance? If they fail to dodge they get stunned for the turn. Then they teleport onto you in same round and double slash.
They need to kill the cleric on the back because he keeps reviving the able one. (But Â¾ cover).
Revive takes a round. "Oh, dear brother" Revives. Free round of attacks (won't interrupt revive tho)
Then he climbs back on his back, revived has half HP.
