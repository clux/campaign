# Morglon'dar
From the 4e Demonomicon.

## Motivation
Might see demon lords return even despite seeing some die.
Might need last vestige to close portal in

### Ideas
- Teadora, Fargrim, Belgos, Lel, and Fist journey through the upper layer of the Abyss
- Attempt to enter the Wasting Tower from Pazunia, turned away
- Hire a dragon-skeleton ship down the Blood River
- Attacked by Demons and Elementals on the trip down the Blood River!
- Docking in Morglon-Dar, the span of Ogremoch
- Spending time in Morglon-Dar, investigating Shemeshka’s medallion
- Entering the base of Khin-Oin, interaction with the Priory of Rot
- Journey up through the Wasting Tower
- Enter the Library of Souls, find Mercedes’ Soul
- Shemeshka and other Raavasta’s are there stealing souls, being attacked by demons of decay
- Phraxas, Demon Lord of Decay and master of Khin-Oin, he who sits upon the throne known as Seige Malicious, appears to stop Shemeshka
- brief encounter with Phraxas over the Staff of the Lower Planes, Shemeshka escapes, party quick portals out of the tower with Mercedes’ Soul
- Each party member ends up in the Deep Astral Sea, must choose between a Black Portal and a White Portal

## Monsters
Demon Lord, Typhon – CC 80 – CR22
Probably too strong for anything.

Tons of good demons in CC. If they follow Vizeran's ideas.

## Naur (Rakshasa Patron - Ak'chazar type LE)
White ticker, thin. Unusually powerful spellcaster, specializes in necromantic magic.
Resides in graveyard / old battlefield. Designates to undead.
