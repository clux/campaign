Dark reflections of prime material. Cities therein are located in folders describing where they are in the prime material.

## Cities
- [[evernight]] - neverwinter mirror

- [[velddrinnsshar]] - eastern underdark city and main base of [[undying-soul]] ([shadowdark](https://1d4chan.org/images/3/36/Shadowfell.jpg))

## Rejected
### Shadowfell despair
Because I didn't do it in Evernight.
Jorphdan has a good [Despair Deck](https://youtu.be/WX3Mj5kkuuI?t=524) in his Shadowfell Guide video.
### Misc Sources
`Ulraunt's Guide to the Shadowfell` in there has some ideas in general (in video above).
Also has Thultanthar (netherese city), and its own spells.
