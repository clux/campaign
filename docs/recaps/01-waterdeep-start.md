You met in the Yawning Portal in. Date? Early 2018. May 8th?/April9th?

Our wandering adventurers took on a quest by Gael, a magic merchant of waterdeep, trying to corner the market on healing potions, by obtaining some healing fruit sold by Goblins in the village of oakhurst.
You rode to Oakhurst, with Filaire, spoke briefly to the inhabitants before heading down the Old Road, and venturing into a ravine that lead to the Sunken “Sunless Citadel”. There you reasoned with some kobolds who had lost their dragon Calcryx to goblin invaders. You spoke to Yusdrayl who promised a reward if you managed to return Calcryx.
Contents of reward seemed rather dubious, but nevertheless, you set off, and brought Meepo with you as your occasionally useful guide. You had battled your way through multiple giant rats, and one enormous, diseased looking one.
And just as we left off, you were wandering deeper into the Citadel, when you opened a door hooked up to a metal bell on the other side, setting off a very audible gong throughout the Citadel.

Players:
