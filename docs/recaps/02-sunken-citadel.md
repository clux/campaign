You delved deeper into the citadel where you encountered goblins protecting the area leading from the kobold stronghold. You killed all of them - one even with a hilariously well placed Vicious Mockery. You found captured kobolds as well as a gnome, Erky Timbers, whoâ€™s been captured here for some time. He told you about adventurers from the surface, with names matching the missing Hucrele brothers and and some Sir Bradford.

Before continuing much deeper, the kobolds then helped you to find and capture the dragon wyrmling Calcryx, based on its icy trails, and you returned to the kobolds in return for a magical hat and a key to a tomb of dragon priests. In this well sealed tomb, you braved magical barriers and accidentally resurrected a sequestered troll.

After a night in the kobold quarters, you wake up, well rested, hit points restored, spell slots ready.

As you are about to step out into the kobold chambers once more, you hear a knock on your door. (FLO).

You notice Erky is gone.
