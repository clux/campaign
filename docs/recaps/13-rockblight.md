On Tuesday, you delved into the sealed of caverns of `Blingdenstone`. There had been sightings of a Drow, and potentially a Medusa therein, but no one had dared to venture in far because something was possessing all earth elementals in its proximity.

Inside `Rockblight` you struggled with the damage resistances of an insane earth elemental, and traded mantis-legs (with magic damage) to expedite the process. Further in; a crystal cavern with rows upon rows of statues of drow warriors was discovered, and once you got closer; one row after another animated in the presence of an ancient controlling spirit.

After repeatedly taking advantage of the `1 INT` of these creatures; by concentration bonfires, marbles thrown at their feet, adamantine daggers thrown at overhead crystals, and cunning action dodges, you exhausted the supplies of statues (including one cursed elemental that you also gave to the enemy forces in the middle of it). At this point the frustrated elemental spirit released its remaining energy in a green flash, and moved on to its next elemental host.

With `WindSorrow` driven mad, and `Hjarka` now with green glowing lines on her forehead, you ventured on, and found the lair of an ancient Drow Medusa.

An early attempt at nullifying `Neheedra` was temporarily successful; `Suggestion` sent her to the ground for one round of combat, but thereafter quickly drained `WindSorrow` of all his energy as he froze in her gaze, and turned to stone mid attack. The poisonous strikes and bites of her snake like hair also did lots of damage to the remaining members. After more close calls with her deadly gaze, a clutch `Tasha's Laugther` gave you enough room to temporaily cover her eyes so you could fight using sight. This lasted just long enough for `Pendleblip` to do some huge backstabs after which `Hjarka` got a clean strike at its neck, claiming its head.

How will you continue on your quest to cleanse `Rockblight` without `WindSorrow` (petrified) and `Mordai` (holiday at the Foaming Mug) next week? Will mystery guests appear? How will you deal with the oozes? Will you broker a truce between the `Goldwhisker` clan and the `Diggermattocks`?
