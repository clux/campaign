Suddenly left on his own, `Pendle` was forced to roll the petrified `WindSorrow` back to town where cleric `Gurnik` agreed to restore him in exchange for a few entertaining pit fights, and for keeping his unsanctioned fights on the low-down.

In the `Pit of Justice`, you met the resident champions `Travok` a duergar barbarian, and `Goatweaver` a goliath paladin, both seemingly under some control of `Gurnik`. The rules of combat were:

- Unarmed fights (d4 dmg + modifiers buff instead of normal 1 + modifiers (monk has natural d6 + modifier))
- No armour
- No spells (class abilities only)

In the first fight, `WindSorrow` took on `GoatWeaver` in unarmed combat filled with clutch dodges, flurries of hard hitting monk hooks coming in right and left. While `Goatweaver` was hit every round, he used his `Lay of Hands` to heal and infused `Divine Smites` into every hit. Even with the 5 AC difference and repeated dodge actions, when `Goatweaver` hit, he hit hard. `WindSorrow` bit the dust after several rounds in a very close fight.

Then, you joined forces, where `Pendle`, `WindSorrow` and `Goatweaver` (with a change of heart) took on `Travok` and his two pet wolves. His Frenzied rage at level 5 with the `Sentinel feat` meant he had high AC, resistance to bludgeoning, high damage output, and took reactions against anyone hitting his wolves, and was not stomped by cunning disengages. His two wolves (at `CR1/2`), though low on HP, were very dangerous against unarmoured PCs. Both `Pendle` and `Goatweaver` went down after having funnelled numerous sneak attacks, smiting hooks into `Travok`; who retaliated with hard uppercuts and confusing insults. In the 1v1 at the end, both characters low on HP, `WindSorrow` exhausted the Frenzy of `Travok` by kiting him around the pit and using the opportunity for a final winning blow.

The three of you continued out to reactivate the infested stone temple in `Rockblight` once more, and with `Goatweaver` with you (albeit on curfew), you took on a final guardian elemental. Brazen after your earlier victories; `Goatweaver` was struck down. However, after a nat20 on his death save, his 1hp was just what h needed to fearlessly throw down a final, ending blow.
