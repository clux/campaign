13th of November 2018
Having signed a literal deal with the devil last session, the four of you were thrust into a realm of trials and tribulations. Waking up naked among a pile of rusted weaponry and bones, you saw fine foods, gold and magical items on display in the centre. After careful deliberation you chose your equipment (all the magic items, genie lamp, but no food).

Fight begins. The `helmed horror` commanding the battle in full plate, a fire breathing `hell hound`, four `half-ogres` chucking javelins at you while the cursed nature of your equipment became increasingly clear. Wand of fireballs blow up in your face, rapier of pride leaves you unable to disengage, axe of dread frightens you on hit, belt of giant strength makes everyone but yourself stronger, cloak of invisibility imperceptibly changes the nature of invisibility, and arrows from a bow of homing returns hits back to its wielder.

It's a close battle where you almost manage to take advantage of the otherwise strong properties of the cursed items. Unfortunately, the high AC of the commander, loss of your familiar + healing, and badly interpreted genie wishes cause you to fail this challenge.

In the second challenge, you fought your way out of an elder mimic, whose shenanigans you saw through pretty quickly.  Any bystanders where quickly assaulted by `WindSorrow` who no longer wanted any part of these infernal trials. Chest fed, second trial passed.
