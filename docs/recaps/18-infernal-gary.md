20th November 2018
Having completed the first two trials, you found yourself in some sort of escape / fight room. However, some beauraucratic confusion seemed to put you in the children's version. Nonetheless, you chose your champions after coming up with the PG answer to all the riddles.

You commanded a Beholder Zombie (Pendle), Barlgura (WS), Earth Elemental (Hjarka), Mezzoloth (Mordai). Whereas `Gary`, the stand-in for the lead Devil `Vankesh` commanded a Water Elemental, Hill Giant, Banderhobb and a Wraith.

Poison cloud went down immediately on all the poison immune creatures. Hjarka jumped into the ring, Gary almost got involved, but you managed to defuse the situation and fight under prescribed rules. Beholder kept missing the beams, Earth elemental kept getting grappled, but the Wraith and Barlgura both did huge damage.  Once the enrage timer kicked in, double damage and a critical disintegration ray made short work of the remaining creatures.

The horned devil Vankesh greeted you back in Solas' domain after clearing the trial, and explained the terms and conditions a little bit. As a result of the trials you are left with knowledge of how to operate the infernal tinkerer. But once you do decide to attune to it, you will have to kill the old owner Solas (within 1 year).
