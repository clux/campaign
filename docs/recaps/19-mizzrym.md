4th December 2018

With the trials done and the previous owner of the signed book staring apprehensively at the five of you, `Solas` is left alive as you venture back to `Blindgenstone`. However, your brief previous encounter with drow scouts earlier had not gone unnoticed and an ambush lied waiting.

Two drow guards from `Velkynvelve` charged out of the darkness while `Ilvara` (the drow priestess that killed `Dhoznak`) made her presence on her ledge known by unleashing an insect plague down upon you. In response, `WindSorrow` scales the cliff and applies a stunning strike to end the plague, then punches her off the cliff. Meanwhile, the rest of you battle for your lives as yet another drow fires his poisonous crossbow from the darkness.

The self-healing priestess catches wind of the sneaky `Pendle`, and with some brutal criticals knocks him unconscious with a single death save remaining. A save that does not succeed.

Eventually, control is reclaimed, but you spare no more time than necessary to rush back to the `Blingdenstone` temple. Therein `Gurnik` starts a costly divine ritual where you implore Pendle (more-or-less aggressively) to return from his infernal resting place...
