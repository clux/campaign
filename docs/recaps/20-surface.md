While Ilvara's notebook did contain some potential leads along with a map of an illithid colony, for now, you enjoy a breath of fresh air as `Kazook` opens up the route back to the surface.

Blood soaked note book of Ilvara contained:
- [[kiaransalee]] (name plus vague speculation)
- Fracto-Nimbuli ([[umnos]]) (name only, later found to be a giant)
- Map of [[telnarquel]] (later believed to be illithid colony)

Kazook uses the lightning source (barrels from devil room) to activate the lightning drill.

Players:
- Guy
- Richard
- Florent?
- Spike?
- April?
