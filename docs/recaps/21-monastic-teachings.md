Potentially last game 2018 or first (2nd Jan 2019)


They attracted 2 trolls by setting camp outside in the marsh right by the underdark tunnel.
Almost invis'd away from them, but ultimately fought them.

Used familiar to spot monastery in High forest (by the grandfather tree).

WS followed it up along with the rest. They got tons of info from the elder. WS learned some moves in downtime in dojo.
Learned things in monastery. Proficiencies, but Boar (Cat) for Pendle.

Travelled onwards. Learned where Mirabar was (without learning anything about it – but it was where they planned on going originally – maybe they can find deVir after all...), and decided to go there. Learned a lot about the Giant fortress by the Spine of the World.

Got waylain by bandits on way to Mirabar. They failed miserably. Mordai twinned hold person on them, and empowered burning hands kills 1. slap kills 2. Last remaining that could talk gives up.

Tell them that they are generic thugs that got hold for a reward. Thought they could perhaps ambush the tricksters that "obviously" set them up. But turns out all was real. They would return back with the sword to Lord Anglesmith (near Neverwinter Wood (east of). White plume is just east of longsaddle (changed the area there).

One they know were seeking blackrazor. Lord they never followed up on near Neverwinter.
They get the poem and head for white plume.

NOTE: They went for it and traversed the marsh after a rest and found entrance to the mountain. Solved sphinx riddle. Went left, avoided trap, avoided trap, fought 8 ghouls very smartly, by locking 4 in the room.

You get part way in towards the left area as DM improvs his way in (had not read adventure).

NB: Probably 1-2 more sessions in white plume.

Players:
