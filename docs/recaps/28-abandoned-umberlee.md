They venture down the elven ruins into a purple vined cylindrical chamber through a sphere of water that Wave can operate.
They meet Cameron on the top painting, plus an old lady with ominous, but unspecific warnings.

Hjarka meets her dark side in the mirror, which shatters. Now she's real.
Chase scene upwards.
GW rolls terribly for art critic and loves CamCam and advocates that he keep on painting.
