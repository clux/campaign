They hire the Artemis with Mordecai as a drunk captain. Zed is the surgeon. Gedesto the quarter master.

Rottingham steals gold statue Pendle from them. They spend the episode getting it back using Monkey Island 3 insult sword fighting (blatant rip off).
This is basically Spike's episode since he actually a genious and is able to come up with rhyming retorts on the fly.
But people seem to enjoy this wacky episode. Party later writes fanfic about [[kenny]] (the cannon salesboy).
