Boat crashes on shore at the end of last episode. Now it's stranded. They want tar to help patch it up.
They go exploring on the island.
Alma is there (planar creature), likes to be near Umberlee, and she tells us that this is her main temple.
Cameron also there (he was a stowaway).
Mordai also fails art critic roll.

They enter the temple on Moray. Find lots of things, lots of things they ignore (like Undine with her fake white dragon).
Find a river lord in a dark lake, they smite him and take his river juices (maybe tar).

Fire ball a spider cupboard in classic wizard a-move.

Then they find a mirror with [[cameron]] in it, who thinks you are the ones in the mirror.
They flip around and turn inside the mirror.
