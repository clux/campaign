2nd of April 2019
You find a mad old sorcerer in the mirror world; Hanir.
You venture around the mirror world and see [[cameron]] on the other side of a wall asking for help.
Many eyes embedded in walls everywhere.

There's a series of self-destructive toads (through DM error) that you quickly dispatch of, and thankfully do not suffer the consequences off thanks to cube of force.

Then there's the Soul Eater from kobold press, which kills [[hanir]] and you use your one diamond on the character introduced in the same game.

Hanir death count: 1.

Players:
- James
- Guy
