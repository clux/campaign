20th of April 2019
## 37 - 6 hour session at Vauxhall
The future is scary. Tower sends out pulsating waves that hits and control people in these void waves. You escape the creature (Dahaka).

You etch your way through the spell box by carefully placing it in an acid pit in the past.
Mordai's patron is brought to the past, but he then forgets everything.
Crystal bowl from present brought to the past so Andariel has it there.

Fight the dragon in the present. Chicken in to a cavern for bludgeoning damage, then healing spirit plus Hjarka soaking like 150HP makes it doable.
3 players for Adult Void Dragon no easy feat. They were level 10 or 11 then (Jenden 10).

Andariel is able to decipher some of them in the past.
They are able to dispel the Preservation in the present after this (so she is saved).

Astral sea plot possibilities lifted herein, but ignored.

Turns out this popululated place is kept afloat entirely on druid magic and "the hunt".
Jenden finds his thesis book finished in the future (origin of thesis).

Mordai's patron tries to get in on the chronomancy book in the present, but Mordai keeps it to himself, and consequently does not learn (yet).

Players:
- Svein
- April
- Guy


Burga in The Succulent Doe. Mordecai went to talk to her.
Busted themselves in, fought chronomental + robes. Snuck past dragon, got crystal bowl, diamond, alerted dragon, went to past.
Went back up the hatch in past, talked to Sphinx, and got quite a bit of info.
Sphinx revealed hiding spot.
They found acid pit in (they may need a diamond tray for it).
Know they need void essence + time essence to banish dragon.
