13th of June 2019
You find Iz washed up on the beach of Grundsgryn before leaving. New party member.

Raven arrived at ship with message about a treasure that sank with a ship; the Aubreck Drallion (rich trader from Luskan.)

[[cameron]] is still aboard your ship and you have a big dinner and steering session as you inevitably head into the head of the storm.
In the eye of the storm you see the Emperor of the Waves, the missing ship.
You row on over and enter.

Within, death, decay, and a tentacle altar (old one style). Room full of rats, and a room of undead with worms all over them.
You kill the undead properly so you can use speak with dead; 5 questions.

Before final room, you battle 3 purple slime which have 1d4 strength drain. Hits Mordai twice, he rolls two 4s. He has 8STR.
Flavour text on Purple Slime; any creature reduced to 0 str with this dies. Oops. Revived with new diamond.
Gets gauntlets of Ogre Power ironically from them.

Up ahead, some warlock there, Command "drop" from GW to halt the combat.
