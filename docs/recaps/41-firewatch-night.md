## 41 - defensive-night
Hjarka catches blue scale and hides down there. As the evening approaches, you learn that at night, the undead come up from the sea below.
Slowly piecing together the information of the Tameraut (painted by the blind priest Oloran under the influence, as a warning), you come to understand that the way the ship went down has something to do with the undead.
You brace for the long night and an attack from the undead.

Attack begins. Empowered fireball on first flank. More attacks. Slow retreat into the house. Pendle has trip wires and netting to attack from in the main room. Iz casts synaptic static and it is super effective.

Night ends. Flo finds a speak with animals helmet.
They also finds the cache upstairs that they missed last session.

Players:
- James
