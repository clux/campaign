## 42 - Reefer Seagul
They talk to Virgil and inhabitants for closure.
"We were always warned about swimming there. Orolan lost his son (fishing) to a monstrous acid breathing snake there, and put some magic around it. Not sure if it's still active now."
Find potions of water breathing and something to equalize the pressure under water.

They head to the reef, go in the tunnel entrance used by the Neothelid rather than the undiscovered tomb door.
The spiraling cavern is a dangerous proposition, single file, climbing, then sharp drops. They find a water cache, but half-way through the neothelid attacks.
Immovable rod helps a bit, but the passage itself gives. A long fight starts, GW gets swallowed.

In the end they get various pieces of food for the seagul. Liver, heart, anal plate (3 rolls).
