Statue (with enchantments set up by Selune) shatters, pulverises. Fine black mist appears flowing outwards like pyroclastic avalanche.
Time pauses; an elven figure appears; "this is not for thieves"
You are sent to the Shadowfell version, in Castle Nowhere.

Everything is more run-down. 5 button door prevents access back. Aboleth lair now a hole of bones without water. They climb down and find a field of green, human-sized eggs.
Inside of them are Zed and Iz blasting their way out. They look different. Zed is patched up and have weird memories about what transpired before, but ultimately follow the party.

In the 5 button door, a black feathered chaotic creature resides (Raven Queen). She seeks individual sacrifices from the collective.

They take a few of the paths:

Goatweaver's path; to the top of Castle Nowhere, and fight a Adult Blue Dracolich Medrungos. It's sketch, but it's a GW quest so he does double damage, and is under the blessing of his father.

They defeat it to prove his power.

Zed does a 1v1 with Syrgaul on a ship, they taunt each other for a while. He is a bit mad (and quotes Sarevok) indicative of demonic possessions. Zed keeps pounding him.

Raven queen not impressed with the lack of sacrifices (they just kill everything as usual). Direct asks them to sacrifice members.
No takers, but Iz and Zed grow tired of it. Shades of light now hits his skin in just the right light, revealing his yuan-ti heritage. It's a 2-v-3 party fight (but Zed has been loosened up a bit first). It's rough, demon is summoned by Iz, but it's nerfed by Mordai's smart counter (he thinks there's a box of spikes above his head (I think)).

It's not quite what she had in mind, but after some persuasion by Goatweaver gives the party a stone for the ring of wishes.
