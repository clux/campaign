9th of January 2020

You take two horses and carriages up North to Luskan.

Pendle/Hjarka/Goatweaver take scenic routes, while Faey, Hans and Mordai ride straight.

Interrupted by a troll (divinity 2 troll quest ripoff) wants 5k for crossing, mentions other troll undercutting the market (Marge).
Ultimately, this was a small job for hex, and he is thrown off the bridge. Chickens can't fly.

Some bad driving further up causes a few delays, but you also get to hear foreshadowing tremors the night before your arrival.

During your arrival, the city is under siege by gnolls. Mordai flies up, whereas Hans has to climb. With the height advantage Mordai kills 66 gnolls in one empowered fireball doing 1980 damage (after some volume math arguing).

Captain's Court gives you a drink out doors and talk about the rise in gnolls (new thing).

You rest, and visit the red dragon trading post, buy swanky clothes. Yellow peryton coat for Hans, Faey goes hot topic.
Everyone in the party is a fashion criminal.

One Eyed Jax is closed.

Players:
