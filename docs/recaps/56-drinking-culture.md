Pendle back from the "More Scenic Route", Hjarka took the "Most" Scenic route.
Cat brought Pendle up after he promises Hjarka will set up a business venture with the troll.
Grax is waiting for Hjarka.

Faey meets Pendle. They go to the thieves guild, but not after GW taks to Celerom about "what giants like".
Celerom does not like Camerons painting.

GW tries to buy “a physical representation of disobedience”.  DM suggests slapping with the flat edge of a sword. GW: “Tell me more.” Mages be baffled.
He also wants licorice (and later ends up buying a whole bar of it later, but turns out he just needed the basic spell component). Half an hour later, he gets his components and a mink coat.

Celerom allowed to look at Chronomancy book.

In the One Eyed Jax they meet Beniago Kurth. Part of Braegan Daerth (already initiated in Waterdeep), but receive a short quest for the luls; get the goliath ladies Orena + Zanu drunk.
The ladies are concerned that goliath GW has not done his rite of passage to Kavaki, (and that this cannot be done by drinking alone). He is recommended to go up a passage up to the Icewind Passage upwards of Mirabar road, and follow the voice in your head. It's supposedly something every goliath must do, and it's a disgrace that he hasn't.
They drink out of disgust. Faey spike the drinks (all of them, including his). GW uses hold person on one of the giants, and beerboards them. Problematic drinking behaviour.

In the end they become honorary swashbucklers of house Kurth. Pendle gets is bag of holding back, and they do one more small mission; raid an old temple to Lolth to retrieve a poison coated dagger; Araushne's Stinger. It's defended by constructs, but you defeat them easily.

Goatweaver runs off mid battle to see his god (and to go to down under IRL).
