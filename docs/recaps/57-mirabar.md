The constructs armor is attempted to be filled with magic. Not trivial.

You go back to the Tower Arcane to identify stuff (including the dagger you took from Lolth's temple). Decide to keep it.
Celerom mentions a gnome called Solas (unbeknownst to you that you have already met and forgotten him) as a potential helper to make the hilts operate again.

Celerom have a 1v1 with Mordai where they talk Chronomancy after he has studied the books.
He talks about the Dahaka, the guardian of time who prevents the abuse of it. Noting it might be dangerous for you and your companions to use it.
Ignoring the advice, you are given a Time Piece so you can use to focus the time magic, and you attempt to handle the magic in the focal chamber of the tower;
the chamber with a giant diamond (actually Egg of Galadaeros). Maximum Weave used and Mordai learns some Chronomancy.

After this, they start heading off to the Stormguard Citadel, the capital stronghold for giantkin.
You head out by boat, follow the river up, see (GW's) goliath tracks in snow parallel to you for a while.

You eventually reach Mirabar, find only a cat Felix. Felix explains that the Hill Giants abducted the people in the village.

Exploration of the Hill Giant lair at the base of the mountain next to Storm Guard citadel.
An initial batch of hill giants are dispatched off. Pendle rides rescued cat (lion) into battle. Mordai throws fireballs left and right.

Session ends before final room.
