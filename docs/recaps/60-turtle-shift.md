Flashback to Goatweaver in the valley.

He gets to Kavaki's temple and we have a one hour session with him learning the philosophy of Kavaki. It's about simplicity.
There's a Valkyrie there, she guides him through a set of scenarios that challenge his perception of color, and turn him into a mormon equivalent in D&D.

1v1 battle with Herfjatur after this. He wins, he gets to summon her once.
Herfjatur ports him to his friend on a roll. He ends up at the top of gilgrin falling parallel to the turtle and Hans is doing plane shift as he lands.

They then wake up in the faey wild. Mithrendain.
Have a bit of a relaxing episode.
Isteria is there (friend of Hans/Faey), calls Hans by his friendly name; Hanir. It matches.

(Eladrin Hotel == Storm Giant Protectorate in dual.)
They ate and had a merry time there. Umami fertilizer on things fed to GW. Faerie dust on drinks, and a brick of lard. Nothing bad happens.

Learned about Berctha the seer. They head off to see her.

They ride through mysterious terrain of coiling vines on silver deer that they bribe with nuts.
They find her in a small temple high up in a crystal topped mountain. She spins what is not a loom.

They ask questions due to gifts.
