## Rimehaze clear out
Counter-suggestion by Hanir that caused them to avoid furthe giant run-ins. Then carefully looted the cavern in Rimehaze, triggered frost bomb chest (fast mist creeping out freezing Faey in place).

You also find the strange elevator that goes between Gilgrin/Rimehaze/Protectorate/Halos (but Halos not available).

You also investigate the frost giant kings chambers first and find a teleport (but leaving it at the moment).

Instead you took elevator up to protectorate. Talked to a bunch of cloud giants.
Turns out the Cloud giants are friendly, and frozen out by the Storm giants (the real rulers, but they are above ruling).

Can't easily enter Halos. Storm giant patrols. Shoot first ask later mentality.
Gluedom is there, he built the spire. Knows it's probably used for mind control now. Somewhat apologetic.

Talked to Arfius he mentioned he wasn't much use directing armies atm, but directed them to Gludom. Gludom tried to scry on Irae (drawing by mordai), but failed. Saw 3 creatures. Storm giant, creature with a trident, and a white lady.
Mentioned they might need to stock up on anti-giant supplies in Gilgrin vault. He has the key (but still hard to get in).

Scrying reveals Luskan breached by gnolls.
Fryggt also guards Halos, floating rock up parallel to it.

Told about places good for a fight; Halos Reliquary and Vault of Gilgrin.
