## 66 hammer of grymin
Ported in from puzzle episode.
Made a lot of rucous broke in got the hammer of grymin from desecrated moradin statue, and attracted the attention of some giants.
They are tanky and heavy dealing even if only 2v3. But this is the first time you've fought more than one at the same time.

You looted further 3 powerful weapons in forge, after persuading a construct forge (from CC / TOB), then walked around all the various lava ducts.
Learned about Akkhan, a champion of Kavaki from ~600 years ago, who knew about powerful radiant energy spells like `Condemn`.

Also took a statue of Bahamut.

Finally, you snuck past an Iron Golem, and you got sandwiched between it and the lair of a gargantuan metallic dragon.

Players:
