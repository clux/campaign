TL;DR south end explored to try to free felgolos, then returning egg from outside.

You returned Gorym over to Felgolos, who eventually kills him. Then you work on freeing Felgolos, destroying a magical device known as a Mytholabe, that maintained the arcana necessary to keep Felgolos locked up.

In the process of looking through the lower right area of Gilgrin's vault, you found a book inscribed by Akkhan, and a moontone gem that lights up for GW.

You mount the dragon, and fly up through the elevator shaft to the Protectorate. Sharp words are exchanged, Felgolos almost takes out Gludom, but they eventually reach an understanding. You scry on Luskan, and find the Egg of Galadaeros to be gone.

With potentially 2/3 artifacts for Kiaransalee's Scythe recently stolen, you head for Waterdeep to protect the blade, wherever it may lie buried.

Extra notes; Sansuri would be granted safe passage to Rimehaze.
