### RECAP 5
They defeated Neri after a long fight where she retreated continuously and tried to revive her allies. Hard battle where she swapped bodies with her identically dressed rangers, only revealing who she was when attacking with her storm bow.

You cycled through quote a bit of healing potions and ammunition, but after both GW and Mordai had gone down (one at a time), Faey finished her off with a critical hit Arrow of Slaying to the face.

Before resting you found a surprise portal to the Faeywild's Seelie Court were you spoke to Titania and had a minor spiritual goodbye for Hans.

You were messaged by Gludom, who had learned some tricks from Felgolos. Felgy unfortunately had to depart for now. But he left you many tips and goods. Plus, you also managed to identify all the goods from Halos' reliquary.

However, you did learn about Umnos being a barbarian known for riding dragons. And you heard Fryggt hard left his post.

With plenty of items identified, and some rough plans starting to form, we carry on were we left off.

Players:
- Florent
- Guy
- Jay
