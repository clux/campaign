Fractured-Nimbuli
25th Sep 2020

TL;DR: Umnos riding Fryggt. Boss battle. 12 rounds. Haste actually expired!

## Recap
Dragon summoned. Picked up Umnos. One breath dive on familiar + Mordai. Then tuning fork arrowed onto dragon via stormbow arrow. From there, massive lightning bolts and lightning arrows unloaded into Fryggt in the course of 3 rounds. Meanwhile GW was trying to fight Fracto at the top of the dragon, not very successfully, as the mounted combatant feat meant he just dodged out of the way and forced the hit on the dragon. All these things combined meant you basically did 500dmg in 3 rounds to Fryggt and it crashed.

Umnos slammed you away with a thunderwave arc, then used a whole round to drop Blackrazor into Fryggt to absorb 500 temp HP. GW went to slap the shit out of him as this was happening. Then he started to rage and casted haste on himself.
=> Res Bludgeoning, adv everything (blackrazor), +2 ac (haste)

Lots of work set out for you. While he was near the tuning fork for some time, he was originally immune to LG so it didn't help too much. Silence helped a bit, to limit the thunderwaves, but his lightning/necrotic blade with between 3-7 attacks per round (depending on how he split the leg actions) meant that there were lots of damage drained. GW alone took 330 damage. He only fell for a few seconds, after which Mordai (next in initiative order was quick to dump a healing potion in him). Then darkness buble on his face set in.

(suprised no one tried to slow/stun him)

Ten rounds in, haste potion expired, and one dangerous round later, the party was still in tact, though without Stagweaver (pegasus greater steed summon) and Hiffee (Valkyrie GW summon).
In the last round Mordai twinned a haste on Faey + GW and they pummelled the blind storm giant rules together.

Tree started growing again, sprouting roots. Voice from above telling GW to "at last. come. you've earned this."
