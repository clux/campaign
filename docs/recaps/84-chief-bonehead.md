Chief Bonehead
27th Oct 2020

decapitated gerald the zombie - his body broke with the pressure
gerald taken to discussion tree on a tensers's disk
jason has the body of gerald and vice versa
he is a zeroth level cleric trying to learn the new undead life in Bone City
does cleric training with 7 other skeletons/zombies

they decide to investigate city further with two parts of an emmisary
thinking better of it, you stash him behind, and stealth around the city

tons of skeletons, zombies around. everyone speaks of arch mage that heals them.
you saw the bone dome where a pirate was performing basic bone surgery

ghost of clairice hide and seek champion, tried to find faey, but failed
meanwhile faey spotted celerom, and you met back up again
(after some unfortunate dual stealth that almost left you blind to each other)

talked to celerom about luskan summoning
he seemed cautious forthcoming
he had been knocked unconcious in luskan and received help from an elven cleric to raise the dead
then brought all the dead here.

they had apparently lived peacefully in bone city since, and celerom had tried to help them
retain parts of their humanity. however, they had been attacked by a devil.

backwards gaze to see what happenend in the past
warlock casting infernal calling with true name of a vrock
warlock had flaming fist symbol on hood.
dismisses the gays

suggested that celerom start trading relations with centaurs perhaps
hay?
materials?

celerom did talk about a protected city called irithyll a bit north.
vampires, more old fashioned. he wants to make them sustainable.
