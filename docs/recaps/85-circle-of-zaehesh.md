Circle of Zaehesh
3rd Nov 2020

You reported back and had a brief talk with Zaehesh. Goatweaver, using his true sight, was able to see that Zaehesh was a devil. This prompted you to call this conversation short and start a diplomatic session with the various adventurers.

You rested, and talked to:
- Sasha Dreamsaur (female cleric of auril, flaming fist) - very reasonable
- Togren Fistroar (male fighter, flaming fist) - kavaki apprentice
- Zhan (cleric of Bane from BG) - knows about Akkhan dwarven hero
- Izak (sorcerer studyier from BG) - knows about Sunset Warriors + this place

There were also:
- Salrius(?) identified flaming fist thiefling - not spoken to
- Another shy thiefling/sorcerer pair that you saw earlier

You hatched a deceptive plan where you told everyone that there were undercover undead in the midtst of the encampment. By sowing this fear, you managed to get everyone to agree to stepping through a Magic Circle intended for undead the next morning.

However, you actually casted a Magic Circle intended for fiends. You quickly found that Zaehesh was unable to pass through as you kept her unaware of the plan and the casting, and in front of everyone, you forced her to explain herself. Even under a forced Zone of Truth.

She is an erinye from Grenpoli and was an emissary from Mephistar, long term research division. Her goal is to stop the undead sentience taking hold, in Bone City first and foremost, so that the economy of souls is not disrupted. "The people of Luskan deserve judgement."
