Argentil Headcount
24th Nov 2020

You went undefeated in the first 4 chambers of the gauntlet on Argentil Peak.

Dispatching a nasty first setup with 2 Devas and 2 Androsphinx.

Annihilating 6 Yetis, 2 Abonimable Yetis, 3 Oaken bolters with some heavy flight abuse (although it nearly went south when Mordai was shot out of the sky - Faey actually barely saved Mordai here by swooping down and moving him out of harms way, then using Sunwuko's healing energy).

In the Theatre of Martyrdom, you kill a Ironscale Hydra (homebrewed with breath weapons) and 12 Centaurs that all lined up too heavily.

Finally, you lowered yourself into Dukino's Pit where you dispatched of 500 Kobolds.
You all basically hid and used AOE from a distance, but GW tried his luck. Turns out he can get attacked by 150 kobolds in two rounds and just BARELY survive (after lay on hands).

Players:
- Florent
- Guy
- Jay
