Kavaki Variety
15th Dec 2020

You represented Kavaki in a mass religeous recruitment drive in Bone City, with shows ranging from the facts of what's going to happen, to over the top spectacles featuring divine, but deceptive powers.

The message, while a little chaotic, stayed on brand, and sufficiently focused and entertaining to get the majority of the populace of Bone City engaged and eager to at least join in their last battle with honor.

Celerom started off the show with magic and a somber intro, while Mordai presented the honest facts about the situation, after which GW entered the stage with Mirror Image and on Griffins flying in V formation, jumping off spreading his wings and running a simple message on stage.

The next morning, you discussed with Celerom how to proceed while also rousing the troops one final time. Through more deception, everyone joined in, while you teleported away and watched the battle from afar through an Arcane Eye.

The mercenaries with Zaehesh raised two devils; a Horned devil and a Narzugon which dispatched of a large part of the undead fairly quickly, but through sheer numbers and divine will, were actually overwhelmed by the undead. Still, severely wittled down, and through a few additional fireballs, and Sasha Turning Undead, the battlefield fell silent. Shortly thereafter, Zaehesh started incinerating what was left of the city.

You discussed the outcome with Celerom, who seemed likely to return to Waterdeep.

Many interesting points came up about Irae's potential motivation. You understood Celerom might have been under some kind of Modify Memory like spell, and that Bone City might either have been a distraction, or it's true intention has not yet been made known. You also gathered that Irae and her hideout, as well as Irithyll might not be in prime material. Seeking her out remains a scary proposition. The full extent of what she is doing with the artifacts of Kiaransalee remains unclear.

The options that came up were; setting up a meeting with Irae through Celerom (risky), trying to find a way to teleport to the new location of Maerimydra (also risky, even if you found avenues with time magic cheesing), travelling to Irithyll (you got the signet ring, but uncertain of the potential payoff), travelling to old location of Maerimydra (uncertain of payoff), checking out Akkhan's burial place in the Boreal Valley.

Checking a less daunting task off your list, you have decided to head towards the Boreal Valley, as GW prepares to Travel Through Plants to a snowy pine, near the temple off Mirabar Road.
