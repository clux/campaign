The Old Witch
22th Dec 2020

Headed north through a pine tree and consultand Sansuri. Inside the hideout, you met Jarl Storvald, plus a series of strange goliaths acting as servants; it was unclear whether these were slaves, or not, but there was definitely something off about them.

After a nice dinner, that turned out to be Gnoll meat, with some gnoll brains for desert (which GW slurped up like a fat udon noodle), Sansuri told you about the end of Deepwinter/Alturiak coming up, as well as a lot of gnoll sightings, and a device they have in their possession with tremor sense, which they had been using to locate, what they thought were purple worms, but is more likely Yeenoghu. Sansuri requested your aid, and offered at the very least a place to stay with food, and whatever else they could supply.

You asked for aid about the Boreal Diamond Mine, but she had not heard of it - presumably due to its age - but directed you towards the female goliaths in the kitchen.

You met `Truthweaver`, an extremely old cataracted goliath in the kitchen, and talked like she was impossibly old for a goliath. Asking her about Akkhan and his burial place, she cryptically mentioned Farron peak, at the last noon of Alturiak, and the Old Witch at the peak itself, but it was hard to get more out of her.

You went to bed, asked Sansuri about the Old Witch and more, asking for you to be careful around hags, and asked to scry on you to see what was up if you went there.

After a good nights rest, preparing spells or crashing on unusually comfy pillows, you took to the clear sky, saw what little was left of the sun up north, and found Farron Peak. Protected within an abjuration bubble, you saw a hut and trails up the shallow mountain paths to a stilted hut.

Continuing on foot, you came to a gate only one of you were allowed to pass at a time, Goatweaver, perhaps unwisely, went first. He came back, having had a spell cast on him, and a trade made, that he got to find the location of Akkhan's tomb, but he had to give back one of his weapons, a crossbow.

Faey went in, he returned with details on Irae's location, her phylactery, and looked strangely gaunt afterwards. Whatever was cast on him had clearly taken a toll.

Mordai went in, and after a long discussion came back, seemingly unchanged. Saying he was the same man coming out as going in, but understood your motivations.

Last we left off, you headed to the sunray'd entrance hidden behind years of glacial advances; the presumed entrance to Akkhan's tomb.
