Tentacley Mine
26th Jan 2021

Entered room, saw someone scrying on you in response. A celestial witch activated an undead Akkhan, who you fought along with the Skein Witch and 4 tanky undead dwarves.

All 3 of you went down from his insane crits, but you prevailed, and got a bunch of magic items.

You also found a journal about how the mine was run, about disgruntled dwarves upset with Akkhan (it sounded like), along with a possible plot to "make things right" involving an emissary from the Arcane Brotherhood. Dated 486 years ago.

Considering using Backwards Gaze, but outside of its normal range would require empowerment through ingredients such as diamonds.

You had some awkward interactions with a forcecaging Monolith, and polymorphed (somewhat unwisely) a gargantuan metal boreworm. The former causing Faey to almost get trapped in a room with ghosts for an hour, and the latter causing a huge tunnel bored through stone, revealing numberous gemstones down a 30 degree inclined passage downwards.

Players:
- Florent
