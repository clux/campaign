Gnolled
16th Feb 2021

You made your way down into a gnoll filled cavern on the hunt for Yeenoghu.

Seeing metal spikes and potential reinforcement holes and crevices, you took a good amount of time fortifying your location and creating stone plates around all holes in the ceiling, then lured the gnolls towards you.

In a slightly unexpected move, Yeenoghu teleported straight behind you for initiative.

Mordai poison cloud fireballed all the gnolls following the death path while creating a storm sphere in the room. Faey lightning arrowed further gnolls, deflect killed reinforcements and planted the tuning fork to counteract some of Yeenoghu's lightning resistance.

Meanwhile, Goatweaver was tanking the heavy damage output from Yeenoghu, while occasionally getting impaled and restrained, complete resisting his confusion attacks, and even most of his push attacks (despite the 24 STR DC). Tanking over 250HP over the course of the battle, and several crits both ways, the two of them collapsed on top of each other at the end after Faey slung an arrow of Gnoll Slaying to finish off the beast.

After the mandatory flaying of the beast (GW 10x40ft sheet of hairy back fur, Faey heart of the butcher, GW 3 part broken top row of teeth), you brought the flail of the butcher (WHO) and headed back towards the frost giants for a nights rest.

With one loose end tied, potential for more information from Adalon, potential to head to Maerimydra's original location, potential to seek out Irithyll, potential to find or investigate the Helix, you planned to first seek out Adalon and decide from there.

As you arrive at the frost giants hideout. What would you like to do?

Q/A:
Go back to Adalon? "Is he related to the helix? both very secretive"
"He wasn't too keen to share info."
But maybe he'll share more now that they've killed yeenoghu.
He needs a clear lead otherwise they are probably going to:
- Maerimydra
Icewind Dale first!
