Information Fishing
23 Feb 2021

You sought out Adalon after a battle with the beast of butchery; Yeenoghu.

Having proven yourself strong enough to earn the type of information he possessed, he was willing to give you a heads up provided you bound yourself to a Geas limiting you from discussing the Helix, or its members with anyone outside the Helix.

Turns out Adalon, is a silver dragon working for the Helix, and a friend of Felgolos (who also was part of it, but was presumed dead by Adalon). He had battled Arklem before, and told you a little bit of what to expect if it ever came to that again.

Also gave you some information on Kiaransalee that seem to confirm that Irae & Co is perhaps trying to recreate some of the conditions this vengeful god. Intelligent undead certainly fits the MO, but he seemed to suggest that the liches would likely reside in the shadowfell while their armies grow enough to get a foothold over clerics in the prime material.

Due to scrying protections the liches seem to be under, you received information that the sultan, Dhaikhezzish, the neutral leader of the Helix, would be able to let you probe deeper into uncharted territory, and Adalon had a way for you there through his helical brass ring provided you provide the Plane Shift.

So with, an opportunity to visit the biggest interplanar trading market in the multiverse, you are eyeing the opportunity to scry into the shadowfell, and also possibly re-invest evil artifacts into the economy of violence.

You went to Waterdeep, spoke with Ursula and heard about military mobilisation in Neverwinter, confirmed with Zaehesh, gathered necessary supplies to get in and out of the City of Brass quickly (with a few backup plane shift scrolls), then headed up to the teleportation circle, whose powering invocations are now shifting you forward into the great unknown.
