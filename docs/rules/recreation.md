# Recreational
Ideas for arts / cooking / painting / alcohol / drugs / other recreational activities.

Think some of these come from pathfinder, but didn't save sources for everything here.

## Alcohol

### Available Alcohols
- **Banshee breath**: white, swirling liquor made from a special translucent wild berry. Tastes sweet, has an effect similar to mint gum in that it always feels cold.
- **Bog Grog**: A mix of Rum, Orange Juice and fermented herbs that, when drunk, causes the user to gain advantage on saving throws against being poisoned for 30 minutes.
- **Cherry wine**: from firewatch.
- **True Dwarven Stout**: A strong drink, not recommended if you cannot handle your alcohol. Traditionally served on the rocks, literally. There are pieces of stone lying on the bottom of your drink. Said to give the true mining flavor. This drink will make any dwarve feel very nostalgic.
- **Ochre Stout**: a cheap drink so thick you can taste chunks in it. Best to swallow and not be curious.
- **Tar Wine**: ???

### intoxication levels
1. DC11	*Tipsy*	Disadvantage on ability checks
2. DC13	*Drunk*	Speed halved due to dizziness. Disadvantage on saving throws.
3. DC15	*Hammered* Disadvantage on attack rolls. Assume a Drunk Persona for as long as you're intoxicated. Failing the save by 10 or more results in vomiting.
4. DC17	*Blacked Out* You will not remember anything from now on. In initiative, you act as if under the effects of Confusion except acting "normally" is in line with your Drunk Persona. If your DP is non-violent, then you will not make any attacks. The effect ends if you drop below this intoxication level. Failing the save by 5 or more results in vomiting.
5. DC20	*Comatose* You fall unconscious and will not wake for 3d4 hours.
6. DC25	**Dying** You fall unconscious and unless the poison is quickly removed from your bloodstream by way of Lesser Restoration, or a similar spell, straight roll death saves

### drunk personas

1. **Sloppy** Highly likely to spill your drink, or someone else's, or anything else you touch. Constant belching, with intermittent farting, which you find hilarious. Completely unaware of wardrobe malfunctions or how loud your voice is. You're stumbling all over the place and need someone else's help to really get anywhere.
2. **Waterworks*** Everything is so sad. Remember the good times? Those were great times. Now everything is bad and it's just so upsetting! So stressful! Just make sure you tell your friends that you love them and that you're sorry. Gods, you're so sorry. Do they hate you? They might hate you.
3. **Rage Incarnate** Godsdammit everything is pissing you off and you're sure as hell letting people know. You feel like you just wanna hit something, or someone, or both. Better yet, hit someone with something. See that guy? Fuck that guy!
4. **Je T'adore*** You feel really good. Other people? They feel even better. You bet if you got together with someone it'd feel great. Thank the gods so many people here look hot as the nine hells. Forget subtlety, you're trying to get lucky!
5. **The Birthday Suit** It is too hot in here. Or is it your clothes? It's probably your clothes. Get rid of them; they're too constricting anyway! Nude is way more comfortable! Besides, you got nothing to be ashamed of!
6. **Motherly*** Goodness gracious, who let all these children out without parental supervision? It's up to you to take care of these babies! Corral them and make sure they have everything they need; warm clothes, good food, and of course, your infinite wisdom!
7. **Storyteller** You've had so many interesting experiences in your life that you just have to share them with everyone here. Some things might be embellished, others might be complete fabrications, but no one knows that! All you want is to tell them stories!
8. **Kleptomaniac** There's a lot of really neat stuff here, stuff you'd really like to have, but they're probably not for sale. That's okay, if you're discreet enough maybe you can just slip it into your pocket and walk away all nonchalant. No one will notice, right?
9. **Dare Devil** You really want to impress people here. Maybe you can pull off some tricks! Like jumping from there to way over there, or doing a flip off the table, or drinking something that's on fire! That will definitely make them think you're cool!
10. **Life of the Party*** You feel like you're having the greatest night of your life! Everyone here is awesome! Crack jokes! Laugh at everything! Dance like no one is watching!

## Drugs
### Psychedelics
http://dndspeak.com/2019/03/100-fantasy-drugs-and-their-effects/

- **Sundrop**: a bright yellow/orange liquid, naturally incandescent, as if it was a liquefied ray of sunshine (henceforth the name). Originally used as a magically synthesized antidepressant, Sundrop when consumed tricks the user into believing that they are happy, as it quite literally gives them ‘warm feelings’. Over usage may leave the user feeling withered between uses, as their dependency has rendered them unable to produce dopamine and serotonin. Over time users also commonly begin to build tolerances to Sundrop, requiring greater quantities to be consumed to maintain the effect. Overdosing on Sundrop causes feverish conditions, as the drug radiates through the users veins, ultimately burning them alive from the inside out.
- **Blackroot**: These black lichen tufts grows on large rocks and boulders found above timberline (the elevation at which trees do not have enough oxygen to grow). When chewed on, it causes the user to have a pleasant, tingling sensation of the lips, tongue, and gums. As well, it can give the user a sense of mental sharpness and alertness. If swallowed, it causes nausea and vomiting if the user fails a DC 13 Constitution check. If used for 1d6 hours continuously, the user must make a DC 15 Constitution check. If failed, they experience nausea, but if passed they gain advantage on Perception checks for the next 1d4 hours. Not inherently addictive, though if used for 1d12 days in a row, the user will feel extremely groggy if they do not use it every morning.
- **Drakeroot**: Concentrated purple nectar of the mandrake plant. When you drink it, you go into a coma for 2 hours. During this coma, your outer layer of skin becomes more like a cocoon. At the end, you emerge with all health point fully restored and any scars gone. After 24 hours without another dose, you cannot heal using your hit die or over a long rest without using more Drakeroot. This continues until you break the addiction.

- **Zaegoo**: Harvested from a breed of gelatinous cube native to the colder regions, this teal jelly causes a biting cold sensation on the way down, but gives you immunity to cold damage and the ability to withstand cold climates for 3 hours.
- **Druidic Dream**: A mostly benign pill made by druids and sold to whoever wishes to buy some. Its ingredients and manufacture are secrets the druids keep to themselves. When held under the tongue the pill puts the user in a mild state of giddyness similar to being a ‘happy drunk’ for 1d4 hours (DC13 con save for half, 19 to deny), followed by 1d4 hours of sleep with idyllic dreams. Addiction 1, 10%, nature.
- **The Ladies’ Love**: Succubus sweat has pheromones meant to make men go crazy in bed. Some alchemists can potentialize this effect, making it stronger and longer lasting. When this paste is applied to the skin it removes all inhibitions from the user, as well as making them more selfish and straightforward. On males it causes them to become aroused and extra horny, while mildly improving their physical skills (+3 to str, dex and con). All effects last an hour. DC 16 charisma save denies. Addiction 1, demonic.
- **Cyclops Tear**: Taken by eating the powder. Causes your eyes to water a ludicrous amount. The tears produced are the main attraction of this drug. They taste perfect and are guaranteed to be the best thing you have and ever will taste, but the taste varies by the person. It also only tastes that way to the person whose tears it actually is. To everyone else it tastes like tears. Overdose causes one of your eyes to desiccate and fall out. Oddly enough, people with only one eye anyway are immune to this effect, so it is very popular among Cyclopes.
- **Gorgon**: Mushrooms, which are eaten raw or dried and powdered. Gorgon gives the user paralysis for a couple of hours and gives vivid hallucinations, which are somewhat controlled by the user like a lucid dream. Most of the time the experience is pleasant but people have been known to have some horrible trips. Most people will prepare before taking the drug and lie in bed or in a grassy field, but those with more desperate addictions can often been found collapsed in the streets, stone still except for rapid eye movement.

## Rejected
### Void (hard drug)
Super grim Divinity 2 style substance.
Ideas from https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/jhepq7/void_and_the_grinners_a_nightmarish_cartel_for/
All of it have great ideas so leaving it here. They also build a 1-3rd level adventure idea based on a cult of masochists who slowly turn into beholder like features (maybe umberhulk origin story idea).

> Void is a dark and viscous substance, appearing as either deep blue, purple, or black depending on the lighting and the batch. If one looks closely at a vial of void, they might notice that it seems to move and swirl about of its own accord. Void is extremely addictive and is injected subcutaneously using a large metal syringe. Its viscosity often causes it to bubble out from the injection site, damaging surrounding tissues and creating large lesions on a user’s arms. Due to the lack of disposable syringes, injection instruments are typically shared among several addicts. This leads to the spread of various diseases, most notably cackle fever, sewer plague, and sight rot.

> Beyond the uncanny resilience void grants, it is known for several other properties. Its primary feature is the euphoric highs users get. Users enter a dreamlike state, drawing upon heightened senses to help them experience the world as much more pleasing than it really is. A more disturbing property of void is the pleasure one derives from experiencing pain while high. Void addicts are effectively turned into masochists and have no fear of pain or damage to their bodies (they are often seen self-mutilating for pleasure). Void is also known to augment the brain’s receptiveness to psychic energies, and this is thought to be the source of the hive-like tactics and mentality of the Grinners.

> Void begins to permanently alter the body after the first few months of addiction. These changes first manifest in the paling of the skin, which becomes clammy. Addicts also experience total hair loss and extreme loss of weight within the first few months. After some time, void begins to warp and disfigure the body. An addict’s teeth will naturally sharpen, their skull shape might warp, their eyes may change sizes or colors separate of each other, and they might begin to become lopsided in their musculature. Reptilian-like eyes and bony protrusions are also common. Less common is the development of translucent skin, which reveals the addict’s muscles, tissues, organs, and blood vessels underneath. Void also damages the brain in a process known as brain rot.

> Void hardens and expands into sharp protrusions when left at a cool temperature. Thus, it is always kept slightly warm. Void addicts who die in the cold are known to become immensely heavy and grow large crystalline spikes from their corpses.

> Void is incredibly dangerous to manufacture as it is distilled from beholder pus. Once a beholder is captured, it is injected with a cocktail of stimulants and sedatives that prevents it from sleeping or moving. The beholder’s tongue is bolted to its bottom jaw, and its main eye is either removed or blinded. The eyes on each of its stalks are then impaled with a needle attatched to a large tube. These wounds are allowed to fester, generating large amounts of pus, blood, and fluid which are then pumped through the tubes into large distillery vats for processing. The pus is separated from other liquids and purified to become void.

#### Void Mechanics
- **Delivery**: Subcutaneous injection of 1ml of void is an effective dose.
- **Addiction DC**: Extremely addictive. The creature must succeed a DC 18 constitution saving throw each use or become addicted.
- **Initial Effects**: A high creature experiences void-induced masochism, dreamlike euphoria, immunity to fear, and advantage on perception checks.
- **Secondary Effects**: A high creature experiences disadvantage on intelligence checks, advantage on rolls to resist dying from disease (but not when stopping its progression), vulnerability to psychic damage and disadvantage against charm effects.
- **Side-Effects**: After 1d4 months of use, the following occurs in slow progression: hair loss, pale and clammy skin, sharp teeth, warping body and eyes, translucent skin. Brain Rot: for every 1d4 months a creature spends addicted to void, it must make a DC 15 constitution saving throw or permanently lose 1 point of intelligence as its brain is slowly liquified .
- **Overdose**: If a creature takes more than one dose of void less than 4 hours apart, it must make a DC 15 constitution saving throw or fall unconscious. If the creature fails the save by 5 or less, it is blinded permanently. If it fails the save by over 8, it dies.
- **Withdrawals and Satiation**: If an addict does not take void at least once every 14 hours, they begin cravings and hallucinations. The addict gains one level of exhaustion for every 24 hours it away from void. Instead of dying on level 6, a creature must roll 1d12 + 5. This determines the number of days the creature spends on exhaustion level 5. After the last day, the creature rolls a DC 12 constitution check. On a success, it recovers from its addiction (although it retains any modifications). On a failure, it becomes comatose or dies (DM’s choice). There are possible ways to negate these effects, including magical therapy and alchemical solutions.
- **Street Price**: Void costs anywhere from 5sp to 5gp, depending on the buyer. Poorer people have their void ‘subsidized’ by the Grinners.
