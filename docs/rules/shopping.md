# Shopping

Generally run Sane Item Pices with rough ~x2 boosts in prices to consumables.
Many of these are better as [[loot]].

## Scrolls
Given access to a mages guild that can produce 7th levels scrolls:

- Cantrip: 10
- Level 1: 60
- Level 2: 120
- Level 3: 200
- Level 4: 400
- Level 5: 800
- Level 6: 2000
- Level 7: 5000
- ~~Level 8: 10000~~
- ~~Level 9: 25000~~

NB: account for spell components built into scrolls (resurrection diamonds)

some people suggest going 10x that on the high end due to scarcity

but it's kind of silly at level 8/9 anyway. who has and is willing to sell `Wish`?
who are you talking to?

## Potions
The two best ones especially inflated because of power. See [[nerfs]]

- Potion of Speed: 3000
- Potion of Resistance: 1000 (shops might not know all elemental resistance recipes)

otherwise can keep the rest at a 2x default, healing potions maybe at suggested value.

## Gems
cost can be inflated with demand, otherwise run rough cost-value equivalence

- Diamonds : 300/500/1000/25k key breakpoints for revivify/revivify/resurrection/true res
