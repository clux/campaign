    - KA-VA-KI: Goatweaver’s god, and hopeful spelling of the three-headed maul
- We find a blue critter in the bag of holding, apparently hatched from an egg (!?). We domesticate it by giving it rats from the rat hat, and call it Mr Crabs.
- Goatweaver has a fanny pack made to hold the friendly critter.
- Goatweaver also has an armor made out of Frûgt’s remains. It looks balling, with spikes on the back, an eye in the middle of the chest, horns on the helmet, a visor made out of rows of teeth, and talons on the forearms…
- AND WINGS ON THE BACK! If we cast Flight on it for 30 days, the armour will gain permanent flight capability, so Ursula does it for the first 23 days and we just need to remember to do it for the next 7 days.

- We fight Sarisa and a couple of giants in 11. She dead, one (archer) escapes (kill count: 12)
- On Sarisa:
    - Magical dress
    - We find a gemstone on her which has a pattern which looks like the Reliquary
    - Magic Fork
- There’s a painting on the wall with concentric rings, which looks like the drawings of the maze in the sketchbook
- We go back to 12B to long rest

    - Ranking “Nehri’s Hot or Not” (ranking female giants)
    - Nehri has a “storm bow” which has a lot of lightning magic infused in it
    - Diagrams of silver masks
- We go back to 11 and investigate the painting.
- Faey presses a button on the wall and the rings of the painting rotate by 60° and some names around the painting light up:
    - W Zilos

    - Much gold (we take 30,000 in the bag and top up 1000 each on our person)
    - Hand wraps/Gauntlets with lightning thread
    - Weird piece of metal (looks like a tuning fork)
    - Robe which feels “prickly” (like a cactus)
    - Tome with a large head (not in giant)
- We cast silence on the door (it’s a heavy steel one with a skull on it) and GW smashes it down
- There’s three crystals/orbs, which turned off when we touched it (and made some kind of grinding noise when we pressed).
- Beyond that is an entrance to the outside (Frugt?)

- The “Reliquary” doors have twisted, spirally patterns
- On the corpses: one diary (belonged to Bran, who died by Fire):
    - Queens Nehri and Sarisa have keys for the “Reliquary” (13F)
    - He’s been trying to forge the keys, using some kind of “Robe”

    - 1 mystery lightning potion (giant strength potion, according to one of the notebooks?)

        - One portable ram
        - One Mastiff
        - One Rowboat
    - Drawing of a key (for the “Reliquary”)
- We think the Lever in 12A controls the prismatic wall
- Heading down to the south corridor (10A) and find a fancy bedroom the north (10C)
- There’s a chest in there with:
    - 1 large topaz gemstone (with an unusual light to it, it’s magic)
    - 1 sketchbook with drawings of concentric circles (drawings of the maze)
- 10B has nothing interesting

**14/07**

- We let him go and he tells us where the spine is (13F) and that the gems are cameras
- Mordai makes a hole part way through the wall to a storage , then we get shunted the rest of the way through the wall
- Some guards have a look around but don’t find us
- After a short rest, we find two giant healing potions
- There’s another bedroom/dormitory (9)
- We go up to find the giant guarding the view over the fancy door: he’s fallen asleep, big mistake. We cast silence on his head & stealthily maul him in the face, double-auto-crit, and absolutely wreck him (quoth DM - “blood splatter all over the wall, Tarantino-style”). Goatweaver dips a corner of the direwolf pelt in the giants blood to write “YOU’RE NEXT – GREEMIN” in blood on the wall.
- The mechanisms in 13B controls the doors
-

**07/07**

- We teleport back to the protectorate and meet up with Felgolos

    - Fractonimbuli is the ruler
    - The queens have been amenable in the past
    - Queen Sarisa is partially incorporeal
    - Queen Nehri rules the level above and is really good with a bow and arrow (so take cover if she’s not on our side)
    - There’s two main bridges (guarded by three storm giants) and one side entrance (guarded by Frügt)
- Felgolos could distract Frügt

- We suspend the battle mid way

**23/06**

- Felgolos arrives
- The location of the last battle of Kiaransalee is probably the location that Irae T'sarran is heading to

- Hans is angry/frustrated about his past future self
- He claims that he won’t accept that as his fate and plane shifts somewhere else
- Todo: shopping from mages before going to protectorate

**16/06**

- We fought the Demongorgon
![Demogorgon | Forgotten Realms Wiki | Fandom](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/0/04/Rage_of_demons_-_Demogorgon_-_D%26D_5.png/revision/latest?cb=20190704040237)

    - There’s some small blue creatures with it
- Ursula has found the location of Shario’s tomb
- There’s a marble entrance which has been magically sealed
- Goatweaver uses Kavaki to open it and then starts pumelling the layer of concrete
- We find Shario’s tomb, which has a sarcophagus
    - It’s got a magical key and amulet
- Ursula recognises the symbol on the key and thinks it may be related to a Vault
- Faey reads Ursula’s books during the night and finds an image of the symbol, related to the “Open Lord”
- The “Open Lord” is one of the council members
- Diana identifies the amulet. It’s a Moonlight Ward
- We speak to one of the priests of the “Open Lord”, who shows us a safe in one of the council chambers
- The priest gathers the other holder of the keys and we open the safe with them. It’s got the blade of Shario’s scythe
- The blade goes into the bag and we lock the safe like nobody was ever there

**02/06**

- Felgolos goes by the name “Felgy” 😅
- Hans returns (he was ill for a while) - we bring him up to speed
- Felgy decides to fly to Waterdeep, in case of anti-dragon magic
- Gluedon teleports us to Waterdeep
- Diana at Waterdeep have scryed an enormous Gnoll at Luskan
    - We should go and speak to Ursula
- “Crones of Tanatos” - cult of Kieren Sallee. Grey caps and silver rings. Drow cleric misfits.
- “Shario" was buried in Waterdeep
- Shortage of gems - Carril runs a gemcutter shop in the North district, near the temples
- We head to a tavern near the docks
- The sailors are referring to a ship called “Pestilence”
- Mordai and Faey head to the thieves guild, which is through the back of a blacksmiths
- Hans tries to help GW read the book. GW gets more intelligent in the muscles. Hans cannot do yoga poses well.
- “The moonlight ward” - a possession of Shario, an amulet. Ursula wants us to ask Felgolos about it.
- Faey tells Felgolos about situation via sending. Response: Callistus. Ward saved her life in battle. Worn out probably. Amulet. Weather good. Ward restored her to full health when she died.
- Mordai attempts to talk to. Celerum. “Yeah I know. Lots of gnolls. I ported out. Saw Arklem with star. Gone to safe place. Don’t try find me.”
- Ursula says Shario was a master evoker, whose history has been stricken from record. Her armour was distributed throughout the empire. Ursula has a ring that is no longer magical.
- “Blade of shadow” - disributed by Shario, unsure where to.
- The stave has lightning powers
- Arklem appears in the books. An apprentice of someone. Arklem Greeth.
- Natalya, kept dragons as pets. Famous huntress. Burial place unknown. Ruler of semian empire.
- Update from Ursula: Callistus was buried here, it was sealed off. In the center of the mountain.
- There’s a giant shake - something giant coming underground from the east.

**26/05**

- We hand Goram over to Felgolos
- Felgolos is not happy, he puts Goram to sleep, then wakes him up, then incinerates him
- We go to destroy the magical shield trapping Felgolos
- Mordai summons a wall and drops it
- Goatweaver bulleyes the crystal powering it at with a spear
- Felgolos escapes and takes us to Rhymees (via lift shaft), then to the protectorate via the lift
- Felgolos says that white dragons are less intelligent and that “Frügt was a dick”
- Felgolos terrifies the Cloud Giants and almost decides to kill Gluedon
- Gluedon scrys to show us Luskan
- The tower of the arcane brotherhood has fallen and the crystal (which turns out to be another dragon egg) is gone.
- We’re going to head to Waterdeep

**19/05**

- We open one of the tombs, there’s a cool helmet with a purple monocle
- We head south towards the source of the Dragon prison
- There’s a few side rooms. One has a library with a hidden passage, behind a book case
- GW find a pale moonstone (GW sees it as green) and a Dwarfish book with an inscription by Akkhan.
- We then carry on to the Library (South East) and find a giant spinning construct made out of three globes and a blue gemstone. It looks like it’s the one that holds the dragon in. We go back and chat, he calls the construct “methylaid”, and says it’s old drow magic.
- → tells us to be careful with magical weaponry around it; for it has specific protection. Blunt damage should work though.
- Dragon Felgolos was last there 200 years ago.
- We’re not too far from Drow City of Lodzafaranzon; actually if we go far enough in the tunnels we may end up there
- The relic may have been taken by Kiaransalee’s new apprentice.
- Felgolos gives us potions of fire immunity (30 min duration, expires in 1 week)
- Dragon Nest is beneath one of the pillars in the fortress
- “Can a spider walk on lava?” “No.” “But what if it’s…” “It’s not about the surface tension, *it’s about the heat*" “What is it’s a fire-resistant spider?” “Yes”
- After much planning, GW and Faey climb into bags of holding, then Mordai casts Gaseous form on himself to infiltrate the fortress
- One of the towers has stairs down
- There’s a humanoid lowering something into the lava to coat it.
- We rush him and overpower him
- He’s dipping the eggs in Lava so that Soltan can extract more magic from them. One of them was sent somewhere else, one was used as the magic conduit on the top of Gilgrin (which may have accidentally been destroyed by dropping giants on them, by a band of adventurers)
- Goram, he’s a member of the arcane brotherhood of Luskan (wearing purple robes)
- Mordai confiscates his arcane focus, spellbook and component pouch
- We take the tether used to lower the eggs (15m tether (shiny and smooth))
- We gaseous form back out to the Vault

**05****/0****5**

- We NOPE at the massive dragon and step back to the previous room… But it spotted us 😬
- So we go back for a chat. He doesn’t appear super happy that we’re here and “looting” (his words) from this place. We reassure him we’re not looting, just being, like, trying to grab cool weapons to fight the evil upstairs
- We then learn that he’s got kids, that the fire giants have taken, but he now has no news of them – they should have hatched, what’s going on? He’s also being kept in there by “magick barriers”, which are part of his “agreement” with the fire giants.
- Oh, he controls the iron golem too. He is called “Freddie”. He calls Freddie off.
- Kiaransalee - killed 600 years ago in Netherese empire, strong charm: couldn’t be charmed, transformed
    Defeated by:
    - Sunwuko - champion of the monkey king
    - Shario - powerful mage
    - Akkhan - Champion of Kavaki.
    - Natalya - Mage
    - They distributed relics of her body (eternal star, diamond, pommel/staff/rod of scythe. “Sigh” - taken to waterdeep. The handle is stored in gilgrin (hidden behind the statue of the matriarch)
- Dragon Nursery underneath Gilpengrin in a small abandoned purple worm nest
- He’ll defo help us if we bring him his dragon-spawn. Also he’ll give Goatweaver more strength if we help him out.
- Dragon is called Felgolos, has been here for hundreds of years
- We return “golden scourge” and dragon statuette to Felgolos
- Magic barrier is keeping Felgolos to the centre and west of fortress
- Giant statue of a female drow (matriarch or priestess)
- We see another tomb, for Urum Emberbeer
- We come back to that place with the statue of the giant drow priestess, and try to go through a door on the left of the statue. The statue FRIGGIN WAKES UP AND IS PISSED, and attacks us with crazy magic javelins. Goatweaver takes time to destroy the stone pedestal holding a magical ruby. The ruby still floats in the air because of red energy beam. Destroying its pedestal does nothing.
- Faey finds a pair of bracers with elven writing in a chest
- Goatweaver realises the statue is undead and goes to town on it
- In the other chests: Wand with topaz crystal, crystal flask with metal liquid and some gems

**28/04**

- Teleport gizmo has powered down, maybe recharging
- We walk into a fortress (which is behind Gilgrin)
- Door with a barricade and written warning about a dwarf in Giant
- There’s a room with a tomb and a statue of a god with a spear through it’s face
- Mordai defabricates the statue’s head, allowing Faey to pull the “spear” out (which is actually a hammer)
- It’s a Hammer of Thunder and it’s super-heavy
- We hear footsteps. It’s fire giants
- Mordai/Goatweaver fly over carrying Faey
- Faey drops on their head, battle ensues.
- We kill them and hide their bodies in Lava
- Navigating over Lava-ducts, we find a room with a forge
- Goatweaver takes some magic giant weapons (into the bag), walks out, wakes up the forge
- Forge: “Password?”, Goatweaver (in Giant): “Friend”, Persuasion check: 11 vs -3, Goatweaver makes a friend
- Dwarf named Akkhan (the biggest, both in stature and in metaphorical greatness, dwarven king), a champion of Kavaki. Is from ~600 years ago. He knew a bunch of cool spells with radiant energy, like “Condemnation”, but the book isn’t descriptive enough to learn it
- We find a statue of a platinum dragon (Bahamut) and an 800-year old book of famous dragons
- There’s barrels full of fresh food (non-magical), so there may be someone living here
- Yellowish/brownish/reddish metallic (quote) dragon
-

**21/04**

- Gluedon tells us the King of Frost Giant’s teleportation gizmo takes us to a “security chamber”, which is guarded by a “construct” which prevents us from leaving with any items (it doesn’t seem dangerous). It has a key to the vault.
- There is a vault at the “heart of Gilgrin” (Umnos sealed it a long time ago)
- The elevator stops above the spires in Gilgrin near the roof
- We need to step into the teleport to activate it
- The hammer of Grimmin is in the Vault! (Alledgedly)
- We talk to Eilos the health minister. He’s got a full-on hydroponics setup to grow giant vegetables and, we assume, copious amounts of weed.
- Eilos has a theory about mind control. They got an ice giant and checked him. He got the mind control like they hadn’t seen since the drow. An “aboleth” (large tentacle-like creature like a giant octopus but with much fewer tentacles and the mouth of a lamprey eel, mostly found in water) have the most potent mind control magic. There’s a diagram from his book, which I assume is “Mind control for Dummies”, that shows them squeezed into a less-than-10ft-diameter tube where we like only see eyes. It compresses really well, like an octopus, or a text file with lots of repetition.
- Harfeus (ministry of defence) monitors the magical alarms that we *apparently* triggered all around the place. He saw us on giants CCTV. He then quizzes us on us using the giants magical artefacts from the Vault; he’s not keen because they’re like super good at killing giants, and he’s a giant. We let him know that we’re only after the evil, not after giants.
- Storm giants don’t have CCTV though, so we can probably sneak.
- Storm giants can both fly *and* ride dragons (!!) - they’re pretty buff
- We go back to Rhymees and sneak through the King’s bedroom
- Mordai casts silence on a sleeping two-headed King
- Faey opens the chests and we find a magical 1-handed axe and vegetables
- Crystal room with a Jade door (magically sealed)
- There are hundreds of flying padlocks. Goatweaver opens them all, then forgets which key goes in which padlock.
- There is a corridor with a stone gargoyle
- Mordai goes through the corridor and it’s an air lock to another chamber. There’s a button in that chamber which resets the doors
- It’s actually a metallic gargoyle
- WE SOLVE A PUZZLE INVOLVING LOCKS, CHESTS AND TRICKERY
    - Eirik secretly tricked us into doing key exchange
- We unlock the Jade door with the Jade key
- It has another teleport gizmo, which we step through
- We appear on a platform in a pool of lava, looking at another fortress (not Gilgrin)

**14****/04**

- We follow the gentle lady’s suggestion to go talk to the ice giants
- Hans sees us coming through, goes “hey what”
- Hans *also* casts mass suggestion on us, and makes us realise the error of our ways. No need to talk to the giants!
- After much debate, we decide to go back and sneak around. We find some pretty cool direwolf pelts, and two “giants potions”?
- Mordai grabs these green bracelets very keenly
- Faey goes for the chest, which opens and freezes his feet to the ground. Mordai helpfully bonfires his feet, and Faey
- We follow the passage and find a corridor heading to a room with statues of different types of Giant (Fire, Frost, Storm and Cloud). In the middle is a plinth with a small hole and some glyphs written in giant:
    - to the very left: Gilgrin
    - the one between left & middle: currently pressed, says Rhymees (where we are)
    - the one in the middle: a sort of dome?
    - to the very right: Halos
- We put the blue gem in the gap with a small hole and the glyphs start glowing
- Brief detour back to the other side of the cavern. We find the bedroom of the King of the Frost Giants.
- It has a weird glowing teleport/minor gateway and a chest. Mordai acts sensibly and doesn’t let us check the chest because “it’s dangerous”
- We press “Halos” and move upwards 5ft/sec. But we don’t make it all the way to that level :(
- The lift stops at the “dome level”, we sneak round and jump through a temporary hole in the door.
- We meet Harfeus, minister of defence. He’s got a green aura and he’s nice. We tell him our story.
- Said we should talk to Gluedon. He was the architect of the spine. He’s “strange but knows his stuff”.
- Cloud giants are trapped on their level (Umnos has no need for them any more).
- Something happened to the lift, so the Cloud Giants haven’t heard from the Storm Giants for a while
- “Halos” is the most heavily guarded place in all of Toril
- Gluedon (ministry of wizardry), Eilos (ministry of Health), Dogsag (ministry of Commerce)
- Lift stops at Gilgrin (Fire Giant fortress) behind the fortress.
- Umnos is the leader of the Storm Giants (aka Fracto-nimbuli, “because he can split open the sky”). They are bypassing the Cloud Giants now.
- There are spiral staircases up to Halos (guarded by storm giants who are on shoot-first-ask-questions-later policy, even with their cloud giants pals)
- Haven’t heard from Queen Nehri (storm giants) for a while either
- We go to visit Gluedon. He’s old. He built the spire, sort of. He wanted it used for good, but times, they’re a-changin’.
- “How can we close the portal?” Well there’s so many bad creatures out already, it might be a bit late for that. But also yeah it’s still open so not good.
- We ask him about the lich. He doesn’t know what a lich is. He browses his books.
- We ask about the mind control. It’s *the spine itself* (!) that is being used for this.
- There’s another crystal at the top of Halos, which can function on it’s own (not at full strength). It might just be keeping the gates/portal open.
- The walls of Luskan have been breached by gnolls
- We see a giant-ass white dragon, guarding the bridges going up to the flying rock (Halos). He’s called Frügt. He lives on another smaller floating island.
- Two places in the citadel to get some more weapons: Halos, and the Vault of Gilgrin

**07/04**

- Fairy tale book about evil dwarves - Grimmin’s hammer
- No input on dice roll
- A mammoth is basically a big bird
- We send Petros, everything seems ok, he scouts. We then follow along, invisible. We see the green giantess at the end of the hall, whispering to the two-headed marquess.
- Petros is “technically dead”, but he saw the door!
- We decide to go for the right, put out a round of silence at the left of the room, and try and kill these three giants on the right!
- We change two of them into turtles. We kill the third one. We crit roast a turtle on the fire. Then it turns back into a frost giant, as you do, and we kill it too. The third turtle, we bash, and when it changes back, the giant we trash.
- One of them had the key to the door, so we loot it and open the doorrrrrr!
- There’s an ice lake, and a teal magical light in the ice, and the green giant!!! We do some good bashing. And very much like Greemin the Evil Dwarf, we slay the giant.
- We see a white spirit rise, tell us we’re in an area of lockdown and charms us then disappears… WHAT
- She said “stop you caused enough trouble already, why don’t you go back and talk to the frost giants”

**31/03**

- We sneak (totally successfully) past the giants to another set of caves
- We meet the frozen body (and disembodied spirit) of Herksak, Marquess to Hjak Terval (sp??)
- He tells us a new marquess arrived! ~~Green~~Frost, two heads, came from the top, as the new leader. Then Herksak got backstabbed. The green giant can control minds. There was also a medium female, but Herksak didn’t know who they are
![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s_CACD904F39624D8448A7870E80111211CA9980C364DADCE17739DA7014E81834_1585681154579_image.png)

- Most giants got turned rather than killed, and now serve that new marquess.
- If we bring the green giant’s bracers, then Herksak will show us the way to his keep
- Update: the green giant is actually a “her”:
![Image](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C0StyORWgAAqB4A?format=png&name=large)

- We sneak back to Sansuri. Mordai does something and a hand of his comes out of the ether and drops the green giants’ bracers (?!?). We bring them to Hergsak, he’s happy and tells us the secret passage to the giants’ sleeping chambers. Then he disappears with the bracers, but we find a Frost-Jade Pommel

**24/03**

- Remote session! All is black, despite darkvision
- Brechta fiddles with her thread, tells “Hans” that his time is all messed up. H asks about learning more about his fate. Answer: his fate is his own problem, but something is messing with it. He gets a bonus question, though! She is surprised that she cannot answer.
- Goatweaver want to know if rope can be fixed. The rope is not magic.
- Brechta learns what a mountain is from goatweaver
- We are shown the lightningy part of the mountain where the evil lives, and told to “stop the lich”. There are several mountains that join to form a single spire.
- What’s the name of the lich? “Irae T'sarran, she’s old, 200 years, Drow priestess”
- Is the same lich as under the sea? Maybe
- How to we undo the magic? Can’t but maybe can see.
- We go back to the city for teleportation purposes
- Acorn negotiation - deer hold up their end of the bargain.
- Hans sasses Isteria about her drinking, then asks her for teleportation. Faey is asked to bring back something nice, but she doesn’t really care.
- We teleport back to the hill giant house, and solid snake it into the frost hall
- We meet up with Sansuri again and Mordai finds Petros (Queen Nehri - storm giant, part of protectorate, ally), (Marquis Hrrksag, Frost giant, ally)
- Protectorate has a large archive of history, and provide instruction to lesser giants
- We sneak up into frost giant land and prevaricate on how to get into a fortress past two guards. Whilst snooping around we come across two young frost dragons who are obliterated, and we take ~~their~~ our gold

**10/03**

- Flashback: GW in the valley, feeling no shame
- GW sees frost giants walking away, and some spectral footprints going west. Frost giants ask GW who his owner is. ~~GW cannot bullshit for shit~~. Cold food good.
- GW reaches a large stone door with horns on the side, and a tear shaped hole. A valkyrie with long plait greets him. This place is for children. GW is not a child. Awkward.
- The philosophy of Kavaki is simple: __very long sentence about living simply__
- GW must determine who is morally right in several situations. He enters a bar, and sees a couple having a good time. Someone steals some moneybags! GW calls them a thief and tackles them. GW tells them off.
- Next room, a kid bows down to an infernal creature. The infernal gives a gemstone to the child. The devil is red! But also, red in a deeper way. “Hey kid, not doing anything dark artsy, are you?” “Who’s that devilly looking guy you’re praying to?” stahp. why not maul stuff instead of sacrificing your brother. stay in school. GW offers to beat up some children. GW mauls the illusory devil in the face.
- “I have a theory”. “blue, white, green = good”, “red, orange and to a lesser degree pink = evil colours” “yellow, not sure”. “Purple, not sure.”
- Woman tells GW he probably shouldn’t just maul shit because its red. Red and blue are the only real colours.
- New challenge! Birds eye view of house. Child with green blade, planning to murder father, flashes red. Father is drunk, holding a knife, cussing out the child. The father is red too, oh no what a quandry, whatever will GW do? He bangs on the door, “HAVE YOU HEARD OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR KAVAKI.” GW provides relationship counselling to father and son on doorstep. “I’m also your friend. I’m everybody’s friend.” GW attempts to convince the child to take up baking instead of beating up people at school. And also worship Kavaki.
- Valkyrie is impressed that GW didn’t maul anyone in the face. GW now must prove his strength by fighting.  She summons some wolves. GW just misty steps up and grabs her. “I maul her in the face”. Flo forgets about all his modifiers and still kills her. She revives and is impressed.
- GW gets a protective paladin barrier that is orange. “I guess orange is good now.” Plus one time Valkyrie battlecall. “Helfyuttur”.
- Kavaki lives on mount Elysium.
- GW gives her a childrens book as a teleportation focus to find the rest of us. This will totally work.
- GW falls into **T****he** **W****hole** **T****urtle** **S****ituation****™️**
- Hans misses the teleportation circle and teleports us in the air. Everyone’s giant costume drops except for Faey’s.
- There are large crystal topped mountains, a lake below, a city nearby. Mithran Dane. Delicate archways of marble etcetera.
- Faey and Hans once spent a weekend here and ended up staying for six months
- “Every went exactly almost to plan”
- An elf hops up and tries to punch Faey in the face. Hahaha good laughs, yes. Old friend. Thaeyros.
- Thaeyros is a right shit.
- Mordai tries to blast some flowers. GW mauls a flower.
- Faey’s friend Isteria, runs up, no punch. She claims he left a few days ago, actually it has been months. Elves are unimpressed by Faey and Hans’ exploits. *Pretty* boring stuff, guys.
- Isteria calls Hans “Hanir”. Mordai is shocked, but fails to talk to Hans because message is borked.
- GW is unimpressed by moral relativity of elves.
- Elves are keen to feed GW some smelly brown stuff between chicken thighs because Faey told them he eats anything. “Fresh fertiliser”. UMAMI FLAVOUR. GW eats it. Umami is questionable.
- Everyone else gets some fancy bees and stuff …sandwiched between two chicken thighs.
- GW is given a blue cocktail and it guilted into drinking it instead of beer. It tastes great. Too great. Fairy dust great. Hans would also like some crack, but his tolerance is too high to enjoy it. GW starts tripping balls.
- Faey and Mordai drink the green stuff instead.
- We are given some fancy beetle desserts, GW gets a blue flower and some bumblebees and a shit load of fairy dust. Still holding it together, though. Elves, including Faey, try to get him to eat a broth containg a brick of lard. GW eats the crunchy lard. Clouds leave his mouth.
- GOLIATHS HAVE STOMACHS OF STEEL
- Brechta the seer lives far away, and might be able to help
- Some rooms are made for us from a tree.
- GW uses his old face as a sleeping facemask.
- In the morning, GW asks for porridge. Faey fails to get fairy dust added
- Elven helper refers to Hans as “Master Hanir”
- Mordai is shocked again and asks Hans
- Hanir is just the formal form of Hans’ name. Faey and Hans are confused as to why Mordai is confused
- Mordai never noticed that Hans is an Aasimar
- Hans and Mordai’s Hanir had the same staff. Dun dun duuun.
- Hanir is weirded out by being the same Hanir as before
- We head off to see the seer
- Everyone upsets the reindeer - turns out the reindeer hate being ridden by the elves. It is demeaning, but they will do it for acorns.
- Goatweaver gets to ride Gregor because he is the biggest. Gregor is pretty fucked off at the other deer for suggesting this.
- The deer take us somewhere near the equivalent of the spine of the world. There are some plant creatures that come to meet us. Faey asks them to move away, and they do. Gregor still ain’t coming, though.
- Brechta is unsurprised to see us. She sits on a spinning wheel. The threads are shiny.
- Goatweaver gifts …a crowbar. Brechta loves it. LOVES IT.
- “Is purple evil?”
    - A TOTAL CROWBAR LEVEL QUESTION
    - 86% evil - FACT
- “How can I see my god?”
    - …he needs to die
- “Is he him from the past him from the future?” *points at Hans*
    - ???
-

- Lasers are fired, and Pendle is revived

Pendle tries to bullshit the troll about princes. The troll wants a gem for the bridge to cross. Pendle introduces the troll to the concept of credit. Pendle can cross the bridge, and Hjarka will pay for it. The troll is called Grax. Hjarka is identifiable by her trident and “island aesthetic”.

**3/19**

- mage tells us to make ourselves scarce after the damage, gives us a teleportation scroll
- head to the harbour
- apparently there are three moons?!
- we hire the Artemis
- captain Mordecai, surgeon Zed, quartermaster Gedesto
- magic goes a bit funny
- some pirate Rottingham takes Pendle from us :(


- they fight with rhyming insults
    - Everyone I’ve ever met I’ve annihilated / My attacks have left entire islands depopulated
        - With your breath they must have suffocated
        - In that case you must have lived a life of solitude, and only ever masturbated?
    - I can’t rest till you’ve been exterminated
        - Then I guess you should switch to decaffeinated
    - You’re the ugliest monster ever created / Your looks would make pigs nauseated
        - If you don’t count all the ones you’ve dated
    - Would you like to buried or cremated?
        - As long as I never have to see you again I’ll be elated
    - Throughout the sword coast my deeds are celebrated
        - Too bad they’re all fabricated
    - I’ll leave you __ mutilated and perforated


    - I’ll skewer you like a sow at a buffet
        - When I’m done with you, you’ll be a boneless fillet
    - Engarde! Touche!
        - Oh that is so cliche
    - You can’t match my witty repartee
        - I could if you would use some breath spray
    - I’ll hound you night and day
        - … Okay
    - You’re as repulsive as a shaven monkey in a negligee / You have the sex appeal of a shar pei
        - I look that much like your fiancee
    - I’ve never seen such clumsy swordplay
        - You would have but you’re always running away
        - Sounds like something your lover would say


    - Coming face to face with me must leave you petrified
        - Is that your face? I thought it was your backside
    - When your father first saw you he must have been mortified
        - At least mine can be identified
    - Killing you would be justifiable homicide
        - Killing you would be justifiable fungicide
        - Killing you would be easy as making a mouse hide
    - Nothing on earth can save your sorry hide
        - The only way you’ll be preserved is through formaldehyde


- we level up our cannons and our insults
- and get Pendle back
- magic comes back… and normal rules
- storm and shipwreck, to be continued

**Addendum: The Story of Kenny**
Rottingham is Kenny’s good-for-nothing father who left his mother for the high seas.

While his mother has mostly lapsed into mute depression, the cannon shop is Kenny’s way of fighting back against his father (and maybe acquiring child support), hence the fact that he *only* accepts pirate booty as payment.

Clearly the mother is suffering from depression due to the internal conflict between wanting Rottingham to return and be a father/partner, and the desire for revenge. She satisfies revenge by installing increasingly effective cannons in the ships of those going to fight Rottingham, but still desires to see him safely return.

As she laboriously lugs the heavy weaponry aboard ship after ship, she revels in the fear they may strike in Rottingham’s icy heart.  As she returns to her home with chests of gold and jewels, she rejoices in the fact that René, too, may have held them close.

While the mother's true motivations are yet to be determined, you wonder how deep Kenny's capitalistic form of vengeance goes. With an entire sea worth of pirate treasure in his possession, perhaps it's not the child that needs support.

And the greatest mystery of all yet remains: who is Bob?
