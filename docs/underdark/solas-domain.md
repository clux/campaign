### Blade Puzzle
Entrance: Complex Puzzle -Spinning Blades
> A huge rectangular hallway before you is filled with bones. Humanoids mostly from what you can gather, and aggressively divided. Almost all the bone pieces you can see are vertebrae sized, the rest appears cleanly cut and divided by something.  These are strewn into two large piles on either side. As you pass them you suddenly hear this mechanical sound (whirr-whirr-whirr - spinning blades slightly hitting edges of paths carved out in the ground).

```
β         Γ

     δ

π         φ
```

- Move from bottom to top.
- Constant stream of blades from North until key stones stepped on.
- φ adds blades from RTL.
- π reverses all blades (if φ stepped on first, if first hit, it just lights up)
- β needed afterwards - adds NTB and adds LTR
- δ pauses NTB, removes LTR and adds RTB (makes it tricky for them to think Γ)
- Γ removes RTB (just in time) and removes  NTB.
- Key is φ -> π -> β -> δ -> Γ up

- Clarify: they are numbered. Make it clear the distinction between failure and possible success. Light up square if right? Maybe present first N steps as a hint.
- RTL/LTR blades are mounted under floor lower further upon intersection with the NTB blades.
- Sufficiently long distances to not be dashable across. They need 3 turns to hit three first buttons to reverse blades. So 50ft between them horiz, 60ft between π β , blades move 30ft per turn.

#### Solving
A hook in the ceiling near start allows roped characters to be retrieved.
Once any player escapes activates last button in sequence the trap whirrs down for 1h.


#### Bypassing
Someone might manage to dodge through (DC20 acrobatics) open areas in 10ft blades, but they’d need everyone across. They can find a similar hook on the other side
Jumping over a set can be achieved with a DC15 Athletics check (10ft diam PoP blades)
Damaging the blades can be done, but it activates alternative defenses.


### Shield Guardian Entrance
- Broken path To Korred.
- Shield guardian has a symbol of two stacked triangles.
- Sits on top of a throne that's made to look impressive. Strikes a thinking pose.
- Holding a bouquet of flowers in other hand.
- A light gem in the ceiling (spell gem with light).

### Korred Tinkerer - Sòlas - (Corrupted fey creature) - Urilyss
Using big bad words badly. Original tinkerer. Summons Xorn if attacked.
Has a debt to repay in his lab...

- Talks to himself madly. Weaves in a word from the players sentence to form a story. Like they're not there.
- Greetings, elementals, could also have.
- Where time go does. That name unreferred to you now by you. Time passed.
- Urilyss talks not to self. Elementals fixing need. Devil must have blades cut.
- Voices. Voices everywhere.
- Devil with blades. Too strong for Urilyss.
- Book must return. Power will me again grant.
- Part of plan, Guardian is. Keep devil in lab.
- Devil kill. Then intruders kill. Yes.

Has Control Amulet.

With the amulet they can beat the Stone Defenders.
With his help, they can get the Defenders on their side.
NB: Guardian has only 50HP left.

### Roper side dungeon
This contains corpses of dead creatures. One with a potion of giant strength. Maybe a spellbook here? Almost entirely hidden, Korred will warn them about the place.
Ignored.

### Book Room
Scaled guardian Devil. Scale down an Orthon one CR? NAH. That'll be the book price.
Chain Devil CR8 + 2 CR2 spined devils. Scale down at start if they're injured.

Further Encounters
Bronze Scout x2 (MTOF 125)

## Trials
Contract clarified at beginning.

### Setup
Solas runs in.
- "You killed the devil?"
- "You have the book?"
- "that means.." He steps back, red light gathering all around him..
- "..uh.. oh"

> As these red tendrils  wrap around his body, you notice similar ones wrapping around yourself.
> As they start singing your flesh, you all hear a sole voice. "Are you worthy?". And you pass out from the firey pain.

### Challenge 1: Lust room
Rusted weapons and torn leather is scattered around the floor this room.
At the sides. Two well decorated tables with multiple fine food items. Fruit, meats, fine breads and wine.
Further on, in the centre; gleaming weapons and items protrude from a pile of gold.
Voice: Choose your weapons.
As you see a portcullis gate slowly opening out in front of you.

- Wine, fine foods. Spice. (Temp HP boosts, deals equal dmg when entering arena).
- Up to 20 HP, poisons 40 over 4 rounds. (12 items of food, 5hp each == at most 60)
- Dial it down if they eat all of it... Maybe CON save as they enter.

Worthless items:
- torn leather armor (-1)
- rusted long sword (-1)
- dull rapier (-1)
- ordinary bow (-1)
- rusted chain shirt (-1 medium)
- rusted chain mail (-1 heavy)

Curses!
- +3 bow of homing (hits self when arrow returns for half dmg or full if rolling to hit)
- +3 rapier pride (unable to disengage – rainbow colored)
- belt of giant strength (+3 str to all enemies from you)
- cloak of invisibility (makes everything invisible to you)
- +2 axe can fear vs enemy on hit (wis save vs frighten)
- wand of fireballs (no range fireball)
- +2 insulating leather (fire vulnerability, tickly – CON vs tickling - action to scratch)
- +1 demonskin leather (fire vulnerability – likes it when you bleed)
- djinni lamp with asshole genie
- overactive gloves of missle snaring (must try to snatch every missle (dex check))

Successes: killing the djinni. Killing the static defense.
Djinni fight?
- thunderwave at 5th level (2) 3 at 3rd level, at will 1st level (2d8 up to 6d8) CON save vs 17
- three scimitar attacks 3x 2d6+5 dmg
- whirldwind (do this if he wins initiative)

Enemies:
- helmed horror : immune to fireball,eldritch blast,lightning bolt + spell save adv + (2x d10+4)
- hell hound (1d8+3 + 2d6 fire) + fire breath 6d6 vs dex 12 save
- up to 6 half ogres - jav dmg (2d6) 50-50 hit

### Challenge 2: Mimic Inception
> Wake up in the room. Damp, water drips from the ceiling, dimly lit by wall sconces. Looks like a pub, but no one is here. Multiple tables. With some drinks on them. A chest in the center by the bar.

Mimic room. They see two fighter. One is a fake confused dwarf. Bofur – fake creature. Pretends to want treasure. Hollow goal. Will talk like he knows, but it should be clear he's making stuff up. He's actually stuck to the floor as pesudopods. No swords, they are stick fighting the thing.

Lid opened by a stick (attached), immediately swallows other (Givraec).
https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/94w0wy/the_mimic_room_mimic_the_most_devious_type_of/

Room slowly fills with fluid, and they take d6 acid damage every "round". Hourglass. (SPIKE TO BRING ONE?). Smells irony.
Window to the outside. Darklake? Hard to tell surprisingly light outside. It's sealed. Metal covers on it.
Windows are tall and thin, like (keyholes) simple church windows.
Liquid drips from the ceiling and there's about a 1cm layer at the bottom now. After having met self/dwarves. If it's themselves, then I can easily kill them in there.

If they search for mimics they'll find tables
Mimics a bartender that serves stomach acid "pick your poison."
Table acts like a normal mimic.
Take damage during mimic fights (acid splashes) make it hard to notice.
Leave the room, dex save vs. Teeth.
Fumbles => acid damage. => you deal 6 damage to the wall.
Effects on toxicity?

> If the adventurers were to look for it, they could notice the inside of the room doesn't look quite right, at a deeper observation: the texture of the objects in it isn't quite perfect, and it's very noticeable if touched. It also exudes its digestive juices at all times, even if in small and hard to notice quantities, they can be smelled or seen before the fight starts. In any case the room inside and outside is dimly lit, making all of that hard to notice.
> Spells that look for living creatures will obviously reveal the trap, and so will a deep examination of the entrance door: The mimic relies on the adventurers being too busy to pay attention, its fine details aren't quite perfect.
> Once the fight started, the mimic will attack with pseudopods trying to bash the heroes. The two fake adventurers and the fake mimic are in fact nothing more than that, fleshy extensions of the mimic, and they are pseudopods in themselves. Their swords not real metal. A very careful observer will notice the feet of the two are, very loosely, attacked to the floor with a fleshy filament under their boots. The room can spawn other, normal looking pseudopods to fight other adventurers if 3 aren't enough.
> The room also exudes acidic juices that can drip on people and do acid damage, they also rapidly coat the walls causing damage to any that touches them. In a few minutes, the room runs out of air and is filled with toxic gas.
> The door to the fake room turns into a jaw, and it's firmly locked, it is also made of flesh material and not wood making it much harder to break through, it is also coated in acid as well.
> Once the room has killed its victims, it will take a few days digesting them, any gear that can't be digested will be attacked to the fake adventurers to make them look more realistic for future traps. While digesting, the mimic is weakened and drowsy and the trap will not happen. The door will simply change shape to look like a section of wall, hiding the mimic room mimic.

Counters? They can hit it for ages AC10 Building with ~150HP. If they start attacking it starts pseudopodding them. Pods can also grapple them. Make up a DC.

#### Variations?
The chest, while real, is acid-proof and doesn't corrode. Perhaps the mimic has a spot above it that doesn't drip acid.
The adventurer(s) they party encounter are technically there... or they were. A week ago. This is just a ghost image, and when the party trigger the trap, it starts replaying the events that killed the other adventurers.
The door is equally anti-corrosive. Adamantine would be great for both, as it wouldn't eat through that, most likely.
The mimic shrinks at five feet /round. Interacting with the chest in any way causes the room mimic to shrink in another five feet / round. So you've got the walls moving inwards, an acid-dripping substance on them, a chest that doesn't seem to be trapped but won't open, and interacting with it just makes the walls close in faster.

### Challeng 3: Children's Fight Chamber
> No game no life fight. One piece each. Rooms are garish children's room in pink / teal / orange / pomegrante pastel colors. Start in All rooms connected through pastel tubes.
"Welcome to the chamber.. Of horrrors..." .. wait, this isn't. Gary! This is the wrong group for this!
Fine. But you'll have to do the battle!"

They get to control the creature. Take a point of exhaustion if they die.

#### Control a set of CR5
- Air / Earth / Fire / Water -> CR5 Elemental of corr element
- Regenerating / Size / Leaping -> Troll / Hill Giant / Barlgura
- Swarm / Blink / Poison -> Crainum rat Swarm/ Mezzoloth / Drow Elite Warror
- Tongue / Eyes / Ethereal  -> Banderhobb / Beholder Zombie / Wraith

Horned devil has appropriate counters.
- Hill giant also great bludgeoning output – and HIGH CON save (vs wraith)
- Wraith's have huge potential, but trolls also interesting
- Mezzoloth vs most elements except water (and has cloudkill)
- Barlgura vs Mezzoloth (poison immunity)
- Hobb huge dmg output
- Beholder zombie
- Swarm (pretty useless, but dominate monster could be useful – DON’T PICK IT)

Every room has "glass" covered sylinders with creatures inside. They appear lifeless until they have chosen. If they succeed on the riddle, they get to pick last. Otherwise they can pick first as much as they like. One selection. It lights up in green. They see it move briefly, before it gets shunted down the tube. Then a another lights up red, and gets shunted down the tube.

**Selection interface**: paper floating in the air next to a quill
Preferences:
- Mezzoloth -> Drow -> Rats
- Beholder / Wraith / Hobb
Elementals are subtle:
- Water/Earth vs Barlgura/Mezzoloth  (who's otherwise resistance to most elements)
- Fire elemental immune to fire + poison

#### Pink room
Covered in craft from tattered papers. Traced by inaccurate thread. Room smells of sugar. Three  different sizes cylinders with various outlines of creatures. Troll

#### Orange room
Decorated with beautiful flame paintings going around the wall. But fires are very cozy looking and pastels colored.

#### Multicolored room - pink / teal / orange / pomegrante
Teal room. Slide ends in a red circle. In front of them they see four glass covered pedestals with the feint outline of elementals. Air / Earth / Fire / Water.

#### Dark room
Scary light. Propped up spiders are stashed in corners (clearly not real) and deep purple tentacles seem to lie around on the floor and squish when you step on them.

#### Obscene
- What’s a four-letter word that ends in “k” and means the same as intercourse? **Talk**.
- I have a stiff shaft. My tip penetrates. I come with a quiver. **What am I? An arrow**.
- I start with a “v” and every woman has one. She can even use me to get what she wants. What am I? **Her voice**.
- You stick your poles inside me. You tie me down to get me up. I get wet before you do. What am I? **A tent**.

Try to reserve Tongue/Eyes for one they fail... last one if they have to.

#### Fight environment
Two large atriums with battlefield overview. Barbed devil grinch like creature stands on the other side (gary).

Powerups (spawns on kill or on crit – make it favour the losers for challenge)
- Double damage on next hit (teal arc hovering over the floor)
- Extra action (yellow lightning symbol hovering)
- resistance to a random element (purple flame/lightning/cloud)
- flight (ping phoenix hovering)

### Conclusion
Bodies feel real again. All their gear back.
- Korred (Sòlas (real name) || Urilyss (goes by)
- [[vanquesh]] greets them.

If they fight him instead, it'll be tough. Maybe than convince Solas to join them.

#### Normal flow
Well done, servants. You have but one challenge remaining.
The previous user must be taken care of. Solas. "Yes?" Run.

Then if they try to reason with him, he'll hear the voice: "These creatures took your book." Do you think they'll let you live?

Battle with Korred. He'll summon Xorn + Otto.
He won't believe them, but he can be tricked to touch the book to waste his turn DC15
Persuasion.
- If they win, his corpse is there in the room along with the amulet. Sending stone.
- If they lose, he's there in the room, having forgotten everything. But is useful now.

#### Crazy option
If they kill him, they'll be taken there as the contract escalates.

-You think
-Fools. This will not forfeit your terms of agreement.

erjury.
Taken past gate of Dis by Vrocks. To Netherjet travelagency. Erinye at the desk. Annoyed.
All are brought, even though it's lonely for Pendle.

Ways out:
- High way from hell (travel agency – given deals)
- Portal room in 5th floor and up in Iron Tower in Dis (many traps, stealth mission)

### Escape
Escape the prison. Attunement process.
They've killed the fey creature, if they've succeeded?

#### Idea Selection: By room spell use
1st room: 5th element style pillars: Fire (red) / Water (blue) / Earth (green) / Air (yellow)
Can cast spells on each of them to activate what they want.

#### Puzzle Upgrade
Do the puzzle again, but harder (ultimately skipped)
6th button.

```
Σ       β        Γ

π       φ        Δ

```

Move from bottom to top.
Constant stream of blades from North until key stones stepped on.

- φ adds blades from RTL. (1/3)
- β does nothing (1/3 if smart else 1/5)
- π reverses RTL (½ if smart else ¼)
- Γ reverses LTR (have to wait a turn for the RTL blades, likely 1/3)
- Δ reverses NTB (½)
- Σ solves puzzle

=> upper level of 8 -> 12 failed attempts based on smarts
guess: 6 fails
40*3 HP between them

=> 20 lightning dmg, might have reduction etc..
Attempts: 3 from rogue (uncanny), 3 from monk (heal), 1 from lock)
20 piercing dmg on +8 to hit from from siege

### Outside
[[ilvara]] - ambush detailed therein.

### Solas' Consolation
Now slightly less insane, still heavily confused, and retains some, but much less magical abilities after severing himself from the book.
He'll want to run away first? Into roper place?
Then can be convinced to see Kazook. Kazook will take him in, feeling great that he's the most powerful.

Sending stones will remind them to bring back the capsules. Also gives them a future entrypoint via teleport.

### Compensation
They are owed 200gp. Collectible from your nearest representative, or directory of

### Kazook
Wants the lightning source back. Will give you the Wand of Smiles/Scowls.

### Outcome
Got sending stones.

### Dorbo
Will have poisoned the Goldwhiskers and started taking it over. You'll be positively welcomed most places now in
