## Acropolis of Thanatos
A black marble temple. A temple devoted to the worship of the [[kiaransalee]].

Stood in a lake-filled cavern with its ceiling covered with thousands of skulls, atop a spire of white stone that held a set of spiraling stairs guarded by boneclaws.

A brooding block of black marble veined with red, filled with misshapen corridors, windows, and gaping doorways. Many of the stairs trickled with what seemed to be rancid fat and many of the rooms had their walls covered in murals depicting gruesome scenes painted with dried blood.

Take some inspiration from Arach-Tinilith.

Pyramid like paths. Green flame water ways.

### Basement
Big ass sylinder that powers some things. Treadmill in the bottom with 200 zombies around a flywheel.
Slave driver Revenant with L4D2 zombie tank watches over things.

### Central Chamber
![](shar-chamber.jpg)
Where Irae tries to revive [[kiaransalee]] using the second egg of [[felgolos]].
Center can mimic https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Undying_Temple

### Her chamber
At the top. Room with info on plans.
Also got a teleport circle, can go to Maerimydra.
Arklem can port there.

The bag of holding she took is there. Shario's amulet will be used by her if necessary (if they take her on alone), but will otherwise be in her chambers in a locked safe.

### Felgolos chamber
[[felgolos]] on brink of becoming a full ancient dracolich. See his doc.

He will try to contact them when they are on the same plane of existence? Or Irae intercepts.


## Hazards
### Ward Spell
`Guards and Wards` spell (vs non-undead / all with password: vertebrazen).
Fog filled corridors, strong illusion towards wrong directions (hard to interpret).
Stairs with Web everywhere.
Arcane Lock on all doors.
Then:
2x Stinking Clouds or 2x Magic Mouth (invitations to doom rooms)
