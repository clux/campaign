## Acropolis
~~A black marble temple; 3 sided pyramid.~~
A temple devoted to the worship of the [[kiaransalee]].

![](acropolis-floating.jpg)
500ft above [[velddrinnsshar]]

Stood in a lake-filled cavern with its ceiling covered with thousands of skulls, atop a spire of white stone that held a set of spiraling stairs guarded by boneclaws.

A brooding block of black marble veined with red, filled with misshapen corridors, windows, and gaping doorways. Many of the stairs trickled with what seemed to be rancid fat and many of the rooms had their walls covered in murals depicting gruesome scenes painted with dried blood.

Take some inspiration from Arach-Tinilith.
https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arach-Tinilith

Pyramid like paths. Green flame water ways.

TODO:
- ~~spell recharge area~~ gave Mordai chronomancy refresh (once a week)
- something cool connecting these (doesn't need to feel big, just evocative)
- rest spell for them?

### Protection
Necrotic Tempest raging around path to [[acropolis]]. DC15 CON save every minute vs 3d6 necro dmg.
~~Shadow Dragon~~
Vrock

## Enemies
- ~~Doom Golem CC197 CR10 (bone based construct from Valindra's past)~~ used in oubliette
- Blood Giants CR8 CC180 (great snipers + obscurers - tactical + they know them)
- Revenants (explodified)
- Bladelord?

## Lore
temple built to summon a god
lore on walls; statues of kiaransalee

- can speak with dead
- ~~murray~~

## Regional Effects
The growing presence of [[kiaransalee]] causes necromantic effects everywhere.

- Chance of being grappled by a wall when within 5ft, DC15
- If sleeping herein, assaulted by `n x Dream Wraiths` CC135 CR5
- Locals suffers from healing magic herein.

## Entrance
### Looks
Catacomb like walls. Bones everywhere. But different styles.
Outside, towers with two blood giants trying to snipe down intruders. Immobile sentries.
Spires outside for protection (250m tall). Dungeon inside the big rock. Big. 400m wide.

![](acropolis-inside-1.jpg)

### Conciousness of Kiaransalee Manifests
- through skulls; "welcome. welcome. welcome"
- "more living, yes. so hungry."
- skulls rearranging
- ground vibrating (2hz, small amplitude, but enough to make it difficult to walk)
- "i can see the light. you have helped once again, i am ever in your debt; larloch"
- "i can feel the darkness, you will be with me to your end; valindra."
- "i can sense the power, bring him to me"

### Entrance (lower end)
Leads downward from entrance. They can peak outside to see the defensive Towers.
![](acropolis-entrance.jpg)
Stairs down. Chamber of deactivated portals. They lead to various chambers and require keys.
Teleports:
- circular <-> cylon room
- singular ones <-> top room (require activation, librarian can help)

#### Circular teleport room
Spinning triquetrus symbol. Two parts of it light up green, one red.

#### Central Room
Skulls. Reforming as they venture past. Form rubiks cube like art.
Doesn't talk.

#### Bottom Right Cylon Room
Eidolon statues 2x sets of 3. One is the old, one is the new.
Actually 3x2 blank statues, stone cylinders that shape into the statues as they move center.
First set has Irae (scythe ready to strike slashing), Larloch (finger out to drain necrotic), Arklem (staff out lightning).
Second set has Larloch (finger), Valindra (hand for ray of frost cold), Dragon (breath, necro)

Center has a large white glowing lever.
Eidolon spirits starts if they activate the light passage.
Spirits look like humanoid, incorporeal, and face looks drawn on like wilson.

#### Misc Top Rooms
**Murray Skull NPC**
A little better mentally than the rest. Happy to join party for a walk and talk.
Provided they do the talking. Stuck here. Kiwi.
Can cast speak with dead. Just does this for a living.

Can tell of the betrayal of Valindra.
- she was making non-humanoids immortl, studying dragons in evernight
And some of Kiransalley.
- she was the deefinition of an undefeatable maig
- wings, scythe, huge, absolutely inormous.
- any enemies that fell, snap (cant click fingers anymore), her side

#### River
Green Acid. Flows with remarkable perturbation given that this appears looks like a small pond.
Actually connected to the chamber below (which ultimately drains out of acropolis).
Light pillars visible, but no paths connecting them, although it feels like there should be, and there's a shadowy remnant where you feel it should be.

If they fought the Eidolons then there are safe passages across, otherwise, flight / acid.

Foreshadowing, put early if possible:
> Large tattered brown wing protruding out of the green liquid. Connecting tissue that controlled it has corroded away. Leaving a small layer of salt around.

#### Right Room; Valindra's chamber and Necro Guarden
Books in there. Note book from Valindra. 500gp diamond.
Book on necrotic gardening. Grows in acidic soil provided enough perturbations for it to only fleetingly touch the acid.

Pet Kobold Snurka/Rorn Vampirespawn tending to garden. Sleeping atm.
- "welcome to the acropolis"
- "Snurka help Valindra, but she gone now, I tend to her garden"
immune to acid

PERSUASION:
- "they are trying to bring up the revenancer"
- "they said something about needing 3 ancients."

#### Necro Garden (below Valindra)
Gloom flowers. 3ft tall. Enormous black tulip with these feeling tendrils.
Influence on necrotic energy. Black bed, where occasionally acid splashes up on it.
Can make necrotic energy more powerful, and (parenthesised also protect you against its effects).
But have to get through first room (where perturbations start acid geysir).

Rorn
Grows on outpost
Gloomflowers CC188 CR3 (Valindra's garden, can be used for necro res potion)

#### Top left bits
Entrance path to lower area.
Blood giant (Eddy) + drow favoured consort (Risreth Zaphrune) (MTOF183) patrols here.
Will reverse gravity on the acid if anyone comes close. Blood giant will snipe.


## Inner Paths
### Library of the Dead ?
Put pyramid head librarian there.
Re-run the attempt on Eithne from [[velddrinnsshar]]

Books of forbidden knowledge?
Got nothing worth doling out at this point though. Maybe skip if no time.

TODO: some way to give players the Blessing of Kiaransalee?
"Will you court death to receive my blessing?"
> DC20 CON save, vs necro death? But then get necro resistance?.

### Basement
Big ass sylinder that powers some things. Treadmill in the bottom with 200 zombies around a flywheel.
Slave driver Revenant with L4D2 zombie tank watches over things.

Maybe they can do something here to release felgolos?
TODO: environmental effects to help them?

### Larloch's Chambers ?
Obv he's dead, but his pet behir is here?
Environmental effect + maybe lore...
Something to justify his precense here if..

## Inner Sanctum
### Felgolos chamber
![](felgolos-chamber.jpg)
Entrance Teleport Right
#### First Room
> Tattered piece of a yellow cloak. INV20; unusually bright. laugh to yourself as you think, oh, the last time you saw something this bright on the human form of [[felgolos]].

Passage is Alarmed. Detect Abjuration magic on passage, extends about 20ft in. Irae alerted.
If they bypass it, they get one extra round.

#### Atrium
(Where the extraction happened and is safeguarded.)
3 white circular holes in the wall pointing towards a floating black tetrahedron (locked)
INV10: Tetrahedron is pointed straight up (at mass above dragon)
INV20: Looks like the black tetrahedron is a focus for whatever comes out of the 3 holes
ARC20: Power amplification setup.

#### Chamber
A large mass of dark wines wrapped around an oozing black mass, all dangling from the ceiling, and further connected to a platform. Immediately below, you catch the beginnings of an enormous ribcage.
As you peek further, you see enormous skeletal mass slowly shift. An enormous vertebraed neck, with bony coils and shining black adamantine plates attached; together forming a black plate necklace.
Its face, an enormous, but majestic skull, with huge lifted cheekbones, and two dark glowing blue eyes embedded within. Fresh black droopy liquid cover its shiny skeletal body.

As it spots you, you see a shift in its facial bones as it struggles against a lingering chain attached to the platform above. Face tilts to the side, almost like there's a bit of recognition, but then it tilts back.

([[felgolos]] has become a full ancient dracolich. Still attached to placenta.)

If they don't trigger the alarm:
- They have time to see Felgolos, bit of time to recognise the lay of the land
- See that there are rooms on the side, while the dragon looks at them
- As soon as anything is touched, arklem comes

If they trigger the alarm on the way in:
- Arklem comes in, as they watch

50ft tall, 30above platform

##### Arklem Start
- **enters with armor of agathys active**
- "you three have been quite the nuisance"
- "but as you'll soon learn, i only need one life to take care of you, particularly with my little friend here."
- "i hope you recognise him, he came a long way for this"
- **casts bifurcate: mirror image, freedom of movement**
- **summons a small tiny helper, moves in right**
- "as you can see he's fully turned"

Will target for a while, but if nothing happen dragon will claw up north.
Fight until it's scary.

##### Dragon
16d10 LG
No charm/frighten/paralyze/poison/exhaustion.
Immune PoisonFire
Res Necrotic. Leg Res on top? Maybe not. 450HP, 20AC. Movement zero.
Adv Magic Effect Saves.
DC21 DEX vs 16d6 fire || **Sleep until hit**.
Attacks: 1 bite (+14 2d10+8), 2 claws (+14 2d6+8) || breath.

Breaths on command (always initiative under Arklem)

##### Irae
Will come in with a Retriever if things are going south.


#### Chamber Battle
Arklem and Irae both want to dodge here. Objective is to use Felgolos against them, and if that fails, grab the phylactery and retreat.

- Irae comes in later - couples herself to felgolos?
- Irae will hit buttons
- Crown of Stars + flight
- Disintegrate GW?


They just need to switch him on. Grab his phylactery and dimension door to the central chamber.
Battle will start. They might be hesitant to kill him - it matters little.
However, if they leave him, they technically have an adult dracolich which remains loyal until Kiaransalee awakens.

#### Buttom Rooms
##### Left
Entrance has a purple shimmer that's deactivated by a panel in room below.
Wheel in center heel changes damage type (reacts); LG, F, C, N, P (LG default)
##### Right
Fires up the weave lasers.
With 100 dmg, the placenta is dead, and the phylactery can be taken.

#### Top Left Phylactery
Large green gem (Valindra's style - done by Irae)
Encased in some protection magic in left altar.
Prismatic Wall? Too slow. Then how does she get it?
Maybe just indigo layer.


### Central Chamber
![](shar-chamber.jpg)
Where Irae tries to revive [[kiaransalee]] using the second egg of [[felgolos]].
It floats in the center, 20m wide, expanded. Pulsating.
Stream of green energy spinning around it, like 2/3 electrons forging a trail.
Triquetrus attachments like a tetrahedron.

Center can mimic https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Undying_Temple

Classified as Irae's Lair. Initiative 20 Actions.
> Spell Regen: d8 roll, recover that level of spell.
> Tether: The lich targets one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. A crackling cord of negative energy tethers the lich to the target. Whenever the lich takes damage, the target must make a DC 18 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the lich takes half the damage (rounded down), and the target takes the remaining damage. This tether lasts until initiative count 20 on the next round or until the lich or the target is no longer in the lich’s lair.
> Necrophos Ult: The lich calls forth the spirits of creatures that died in its lair. These apparitions materialize and attack one creature that the lich can see within 60 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 18 Constitution saving throw, taking 52 (15d6) necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a success. The apparitions then disappear.
> Summon a Revenant with Great Reveance. Revenants explode.

### Her chamber
At the top. Room with info on plans.
Also got a teleport circle, can go to Maerimydra.
Arklem can port there.

The bag of holding she took is there. Shario's amulet will be used by her if necessary (if they take her on alone), but will otherwise be in her chambers in a locked safe.


## Hazards
### Ward Spell
`Guards and Wards` spell (vs non-undead / all with password: vertebrazen).
Fog filled corridors, strong illusion towards wrong directions (hard to interpret).
Stairs with Web everywhere.
Arcane Lock on all doors.
Then:
2x Stinking Clouds or 2x Magic Mouth (invitations to doom rooms)
