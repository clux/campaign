## Chief Herald
Herald of Undeath CC218 CR11.
Taking orders from Irae. Giving orders to puppet cities. Marsember one of the cities.
He's the main cemetary raiser who brought most of Luskan to a nearby skeleton puppet city.

## Chief Advisor
[[celerom]].
TODO: Maybe Baphomet savaged Neverwinter?

Wants this kept on the down-low.
In the end, he can use Chronomancy to Timestake back and avoid the fight.
But he will TRY to persuade them that this is good.
Likely, the party will find philosophical holes in his stance, particularly now if he's about to become a lich. TODO: maybe he already has become one? Nah. He's just convinced now by Arklem and Irae.

TODO: arklem might be talking negatively about orcus being lost, but at least slow and steady is good for our stealth. NB: this is meant for wherever the lich's union is set.
