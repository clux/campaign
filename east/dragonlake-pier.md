## Meeting
She'll port in with the druid and guardian. Out from a Plane Shift.

Celerom CAN be there, but he won't fight for party. Takes a magical oath of neutrality.
Casts a spell on the statue, and sequesters himself there as a way to signal its start.

Orbiting her head is this magical crown (bit like an Ioun stone)
She smiles upon seeing you. "So, we meet again. Almost didn't expect you'd show up."

## Wipe?
If they Wipe. Celerom can help them. 2/3 resurrected. The last needs divine intervention.
