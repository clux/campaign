# Epilogue

Started in [[neverwinter]] in 125
Roll HP for 17.

NB: Original place where Stage2 happened has formed into a unique gemstones forming after the crazy damage. (Kiaransalite beautiful radiant orange gemstone that seem to emanate a soothing white flame not warm, not cold, just soothing)

## Conversations
### Diana/Ursula Chronomancy (Mordai)
(GW still in Tenser's Transformation, DC15 CON save vs exhaust)

- "That was amazing, all of you."
- "That is one colorful paladin you got." (Describe tenser's + teal 3-boob suit, burning red orcus wand).
- To Mordai: "I've never seen someone cast spells as fast as you did there. If this is the power of chronomancy, then, wow. I know this is soon, but at some point, when you've had some time to think. We could use teachers at the mages guild to help improve the quality of our students."

- Ursula about Staff if GW keeps it: "You know, that Wand Goatweaver is using seems a lot more powerful than I thought originally. Do you think he'll be able to handle it?"

## Sahaquiel Ending (Mordai)
key points:
- kiransalee can return if chronomancy still exists
- mordai must modify memory on ursula/diana/sansury/celerom
- [[dahaka]] will intercede in second half if nothing is done / after memory wipes
- "there's only one thing left to do now mordai. it's time to forget what you know about chronomancy. time is not a circle if you do not tamper with it. you can forge your destiny without this magic, you will be a powerful sorcerer, that does not end up as a set of artifacts 500 years down the line when new liches rise. you will forget some things however. you will think you never met me, some aspects of your struggle against the chronomantic liches will seem strange to you, that's because your mind will try to make sense of minor inconsistencies in my modify memory."
- Level 17 Celestial Sorcerer when it happens - no memory of patrons/chronomancy or casting of such spells. But remembers the epic battle you had and the sheer number of fireballs you got out. It's hard to pinpoint everything that went down in those fateful minutes, but you, Goatweaver and Faeynore all got together and performed to your fullest.
- TODO: how to get him to eldritch blast?

### Galeron Gilbert (Party)
shouts from side-street "NO DONT". Hear a crossbow bolt release. **Clank**
Rush in to see Galeron and one graycloak hiding behind pieces of wood as a crossbow bolt flies over your heads from across the streets. Hear soft broken esophagus noises, something is definitely there.
> What do you do?
- save / kill Gilbert.
If kill? Galeron will be upset, but will come around later in the episode (if they're there).
If save? Galeron thankful (even though kid will need some care).
- "oh my god, what a slaughter that was. "

(INTERJECT resurrections potential below)

- "but, still, we are alive. and you did it. boy i hope this is the last time you come to me with bad news. listen, i need some time, maybe come see me tomorrow."

### Galeron Funeral/Resurrections (Goatweaver)
- "That is a lot of dead soldiers.. so many promising 20 years olds."
- "Our numbers are decimated. How will we ever recover from this"

technically, gw can res one/two per day with the wand if he'll risk it. Will trigger Wand of Orcus saves and hopefully we can lean into that.

- "We will have to hold a funeral tomorrow. Will you help?"
- (maybe they can help with a boat)

..one father comes rushing in angrily in face of the more stoic galeron
- "no, you cannot let this happen, you have the most powerful clerics and paladins right here and now, you must be able to revive them, please."
- Ursula: "it's too many. we do not have components for that type of large scale tampering with mortality."
(pm gw that he has resurrection on his staff, 3 per day, could do it in a month)
(nice moral choice for him, save hundred people, at a small cost to himself)

### Galeron Watchers (Faey)
Next day:
- Faeynore, is it. I realize that we never spoke much. But just gotta say, that was some brilliant shooting. I've never seen anyone move so fast and shoot so accurately from such distances.
- Faeynore proposal re: watchers. I know that you probably have your own place to go to, but maybe you would consider staying here. Our numbers are severly diminished, and we are not going to be able to protect or watch over anything, much less contain the undead plague from the cemetery.
- I know this probably isn't a substitute for your home, but you have the tower, you can come and go as you please.
- Isn't the faeywild all around us? Is there some version of this place that you can watch over as a watcher? That way you'll be close to us.

-> arch-faey in faeywild (variant of neverwinter || or his home)
-> potential future quests for faey and party to clear out the undead

## Scythe Prophecy (Faey/Mordai)
Scythe on the ground. Not attunable by them.
https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2391663-scythe-of-the-revenancer
Can take it apart, but not destroy the pieces.

However prophecy of the [[undying-soul]]:
> The aligned three avenges that which came before. They shall become the true harbingers of the long peace. Through all means necessary, the errors of the past shall be corrected, and through conflict, peace will return. So sayeth the revenancer.
**This actually happened; but the aligned three were them.**

Potential future stupid quest: destroy [[orcus]] with it (highlighted in flavour text on the scythe) to forever destroy the scythe.

## Galeron - Halls of Justice (Goatweaver)
He needs "reliable sources" for his judgement.
- Ursula can vouch for him (he has his heart in the right place, and he is gathering immense power as a patron of Kavaki, that much is obvious - I have no doubt that he can use his powers for good in this city)
- Gregor will absolutely not vouch for him.
- Celerom can vouch for him. He can find a solution to the most complex moral dilemma, and he has friends behind him to help him out, if he, uh, gets confused.
- Adalon can vouch for him. Someone behind a god of goliaths is not going to be a pushover. As a vengeance paladin he is a great candidate for running the punitive system. You will have no beauraucracy, and with his lifelong quest for justice, I think he's had more practice than anyone in identifying who's right or wrong.

## Kavaki (Goatweaver)
Maybe he can retire up there with Kavaki as his bro friend. What would they do? Go on long hikes in Gladsheim? Try to have GW help him date Selune?

## Wand of Orcus (Goatweaver)
Uses it?
Failures => At first - 2d8 necro damage ("i must feed")). GW can probably just start seeing this as an analogue of how Mordai uses self-dmg to cast chronomancy to rationalise it. "Another spell cast, another bit of blood flowing through and out of the muscles, nothing you feel haven't seen before. Taking damage is a natural state of spell casting, you've seen Sucy heal with Life Transference, you've seen Mordai use chronomancy, there's always some cost to high powered wizardry, and this isn't anything you'd struggle paladin heal in an instant. In fact, getting the blood flowing like this actually feels kind of good. Reminds you of those easier mauling days when the faces were at face height, and the face armor was just normal face bone armor."
Failures repeated => sees red in places he shouldn't, slow decent into madness

Ignoring it for half a session => Wand pipes in: "It is time for you to complete your end of the bargain." (hopefully they try out spells so we can roleplay the rest, try to force the resurrection scenario).

Charisma save DC30 to give it up (one time roll, can use luck, he has +15). "You have used me for your personal vengeance, our journey does not end until you have completed your side of the deal. What type of paladin would you be if you were willing to lie?"

If he succeeds in dropping it, then they can do what they wish with the staff and be gone with this arc. Mages are happy, but graycloaks remain dead.

WIS DC is 20 now. Goes up by 1 each cast. After that it takes HP from him (not an amount he can't deal with), and if very unlucky causes chaos effects. Long term madness described above. If he resists this, go into the more comedic failure wand scenario:

- (used to resurrect battlefield): "I swear if you're going to use me for this repeatedly, I am going to throw up."
- (on sequestring): "This will only delay the inevitable; the hand of my master holding my
stiff shaft and swinging me around."
- (if reactions): "Do not play these word games. A mace does not care about the orifice into which it is plunged." or "Do not play this game, I swing both ways." or "Do not include me in talk about your man dinglers. I must return to the blood lord to feed."
- (mechanics): plane shift me to the Black Despot in Morglon'dar, and I shall free your hand of my girth.

cliffhanger potential if he keeps it:
- highlight red sense on a kid picking up a flower (technically stealing from a house's garden, to give to mommy)
- staff throws up: "That's it! I cannot deal with your continued use. I must rest." -> red sparkling magic around the face of the mace, suddenly coalesces into this blob that's then **throw up noises** ejected all over your armor. light diminishes in the wand. and your armor gets a strong red stain.
- as the sun sets: and a new look on good and evil, you carry out your path, with the Wand of Orcus as your gavel, and the unfaltering judgement of Kavaki behind you. finally, you can focus on delivering justice to the world. sure, the wand is a little stubborn and painful sometimes, but in a way it's nice to be reminded of the mortality and limits of your body. and hey, you can stop time now, who is going to want to pick a fight over the staff with the Champion of Kavaki, the Archmage of Waterdeep; Lahevik Goatweaver.

If he does relinquish it:
- Mages award him a Potion of longevity for GW (1d6+6 years younger 90% chance).
- Galeron gets the blacksmith to create a "Golden" `Maul to the City` +0 ceremonial, +2 CHA (not actually golden, just a coating, but has Kiaransalite inserted)
- Maul to the City: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/31173422412120668/

### Funeral Ceremony (Party)
If they do not follow the wand to resurrect, and instead have to hold a funeral.
Maybe they can bring a boat.

Maybe here GW can get his rewards (to highlight that they are the protectors of the city).

## Denouement (EP name)
TODO: Handle last part of Session Omega.
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/g8pogt/session_omega_ending_the_campaign/

## Plan
### Immediate Stage
- Diana/Ursula
- Gilbert
- Resurrections
- Wand of Orcus first attempts and decisions
- ANYTHING THEY WANT TO DO

### Second Stage
- Galeron + Faey
- Ceremony (Funeral or something else)?
- Mordai + Dahaka
- TODO: something for faey to help hjarka?
- TODO: Halls of Justice / Kavaki Bro strats?

### Mordai
Needs to Modify Memory on Ursula/Diana/Sansuri to end it and he's free.
Gets a chance during Diana/Ursula encounter
Need to remind him of consequences if it's not upheld?

TODO:
- patron clearup.
- Sever his ties with patron and divine faiths.

A breakthrough feat that lets him retrofit his knowledge by actually using the weave.

### Faey
- Arch-faey manager route via Galeron above.
- TODO: Something from Sahaquiel about Hjarka?

### GW
For wand, go through Gilbert and resurrections first, then either:
- if they get rid of the wand -> Mages Happy, Graycloaks dead. Longevity. Maul to the City.
- if they keep the wand -> Mages scared, Graycloaks alive. Slowly maddening GW?

NB: they can get rid of the wand in two ways (drop + sequester or plane shift it)
- Plane Shift is safest (and ultimate fallback)
- Otherwise, if they succeed, they can riff a bit on it

Then misc:
- Kavaki bro strats
- Halls of Justice

TODO:
- maybe a farm for his pets? https://i.redd.it/ry57if0dpsf71.jpg
- private kavaki shrine? https://i.redd.it/dvji9bam8gn71.jpg

## Ideas
### Gifts
https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/joegou/20_friendly_npcs_bittersweet_last_gifts_to_pcs/

https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/jxmzw0/ocartbring_out_the_best_in_your_boy_with_the_band/ for GW?

## Extras
### Cliffhangers
Need a cliffhanger to indicate that the world is still alive and you intend to keep playing with your friends.

- GW keeping orcus staff -> blurring the line of good and evil
- Mordai keeping chronomancy -> sahaquiel ending

### Waterdeep
[[gregor]], they kind of saved him. it's probably best if his ending is left vague.
he's both mad and somehow thankful (but he doesn't even know where the rubies came from).
meeting the party would be weird, he's got mostly anger towards them.

### Neverwinter
Soulcage for Raffolk found? They have to go after it.
Galeron can set it up if we seed Gilbert.
