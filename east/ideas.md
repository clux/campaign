## East
Dial down battle focus.
Allow more RP in battle..
Non-combat solutions.
Allow yourself

Make a situation/ecosystem that is so vibrant/multifaceted, so that even you as the DM has the capacity to be surprised by what the players will do.
Not like a puzzle (with a correct solution), but like a playground. Lava, rickety bridges, summonable monster. Make things intuitive, at birds eye level.
Airship battle over a volcano is dangerous, but let them do it.

## nuclear waste warning
Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture. This place is not a place of honor.. no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here.. nothing valued is here. What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us.

This message is a warning about danger. The danger is in a particular location... it increases towards a center... the center of danger is here... of a particular size and shape, and below us. The danger is still present in your time, as it was in ours. The danger is to the body, and it can kill. The form of the danger is an emanation of energy. The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically.

This place is best left shunned and uninhabited.

## Horsemen
Prosperity: A "white horseman" who is a figurehead for the prevailing religion, and essentially arrives to foretell the coming apocalypse, but also represents the apparent strength of the societies that will come to ruin.
Turmoil: A "white horseman" who is the figurehead for the "opposing force" of whatever the prevailing religion is, essentially representing the immediate confusion and uncertainty that follows the first sign of the apocalypse.
Conquest: A "white horseman" who represents the War that ensues between the prosperous society and their invasion by their religious opposition.
Pestilence: A "white horseman" who represents the spread of disease in the aftermath of the following conflict.
Division: A "red horseman" who represents the separation of existing factions, largely due to the segregation that follows the infectious disease represented by pestilence.
Strife: A "red horseman" who represents the ensuing civil war that comes from these segregated groups turning on each other.
War: A "red horseman" who represents the combined forces of violence that are coming from both from inside and outside.
Oppression: A "black horseman" who represents the forces of government wringing their populace dry in attempts to weaken the rebel fighters while bolstering their own military forces who are fighting a battle on two fronts.
Famine: A "black horseman" who represents the collective loss of resources. The few non-combatant locals are being heavily exploited, many of the farms cannot be tended and cannot provide for the military, especially as the invaders either overtake or burn the farms they encounter.
Death: The "Pale Horseman" who comes to represent the end. The conflict eventually dies down as death arrives. The collective weight of every previous horsemen having completely beaten down every aspect of society. It's almost a peaceful end, as many pass away in their sleep from injury, disease or starvation, and that which used to be society is reclaimed by nature, and it's wild beasts.
