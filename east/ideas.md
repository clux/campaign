Dial down battle focus.
Allow more RP in battle..
Non-combat solutions.
Allow yourself

Make a situation/ecosystem that is so vibrant/multifaceted, so that even you as the DM has the capacity to be surprised by what the players will do.
Not like a puzzle (with a correct solution), but like a playground. Lava, rickety bridges, summonable monster. Make things intuitive, at birds eye level.
Airship battle over a volcano is dangerous, but let them do it.

## nuclear waste warning
Sending this message was important to us. We considered ourselves to be a powerful culture. This place is not a place of honor.. no highly esteemed deed is commemorated here.. nothing valued is here. What is here was dangerous and repulsive to us.

This message is a warning about danger. The danger is in a particular location... it increases towards a center... the center of danger is here... of a particular size and shape, and below us. The danger is still present in your time, as it was in ours. The danger is to the body, and it can kill. The form of the danger is an emanation of energy. The danger is unleashed only if you substantially disturb this place physically.

This place is best left shunned and uninhabited.
