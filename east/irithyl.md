# Irithyl
Build on the ancient city of Irithyl. Gothic arcitecture. Dim blue light from the full moon. Eternal night here (crazy spell from vampires).
(Irithyl from DS3.)
Inhabitants the undead from Luskan.
City situated on a hil, and there's a central path winding around the side of the hill up into a residential area.
At the top, amongst many mausoleum looking structures are a large arc leading into the cathedral area.
Many small streets between houses winding up and down (very up and down arcitecture, built organically over time).
Some small streets lead up to the less stable cliff faces of the mountain, can walk around there, to get a view of the western part of the city.
One path underneath leading to Irithyl dungeon. Huge crypt.
Paths wind around a lot. Can find paths to a swamp on the eastern cide.
Swamp leads to water (still < knee deep) which reveals - under one of the southern bridges - a sewer entrance. Undead drow. Path up to an active kitchen. Leads to a large cathedral central hall. Magnificent central furniture. Looks old. Many paintings of the city. Ghost fight, buttfucking archer.
Other side leads up cathedral walls in the east and out into eastern side, which also winds around other side of city. Eastern side has a elevator (many enemies that way).
Eastern side winds up in small bridges towards cathedral entrance.
Skull Lanterns everywhere. CC343

This is the be the main vampire city with the council.
Need an item to pass the magnetosphere around the city;
- a doll
- an audience granted with vampire council (via Celerom)

TODO: why go to the dungeon?

## Magnetosphere
Some spells do not work within the city. Teleport, flight, plane shift, misty step. There's eternal moonlight. => Ensures they have to fight their way out if the vampires do not like what they hear.

## Maps
repurpose from https://www.polygon.com/2017/1/17/14193428/dark-souls-3-maps-guide-enemies-items

## Old Church
Lairs a BOSS. Summoned by the liches to provide stability of Council.
Can be bypassed by walking around the city, though this will draw the attention of inhabitants.

Main powerhouse of the region - can be used against Nekrina later
Maybe they fight it on the way out, if they angered the vampires. That fight allows them to use terrain and prioritise other undead.

## Cathedral; Vampire Council
Undead + Zombies rule at day.

Vampire, Patricians most reasonable here (noblemen turned to vampirism).
More easy for them to argue for sustainability. CC365 CR10
Perhaps a disgruntled Vampire Priestess CC367, CR8 who do not fully appreciate the new lifestyle, but her lust for revolution does not have a voice with the populus (mostly skeletons).
Personal guard on the council; Vampire Knight CC379 CR11
Zombie Lord; CC394 CR5

Central conflict; Vampires want to freedom and their empire to continue, and leech of nearby slaves. Irae's plans are both with and against them. Celerom wants to reform them into vegetarians. But they are VERY old fashioned. One will not change at all, but the younger ones MIGHT. The old one COULD betray them and destroy the charm from Celerom to force them out.

### Council conflict
TODO: arklem might be talking negatively about orcus being lost, but at least slow and steady is good for our stealth. NB: this is meant for wherever the lich's union is set.

Some of the vampires are skeptical of Celerom's approach, but about half of them are on board. Arklem not concerned with this, he's a tactician. He wants the plan to progress quickly now that demon lords have been weakened.

## Dungeon
Worshippers of Irae granting her divine powers.
Normally, the deacons would worship Kiaransalee, but Irae wants the powers directly.

in swamp; Drowned Maidens CR5 TOB163 (long haired roper girls in white dresses)
could also put some Shrouds (CR1/8 TOB438) squire specters with strength drain
