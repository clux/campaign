# Irithyll Oubliette
Arklem's domain.

## Dungeon Concept
Tons of cloudkill gas everywhere.
Tons of Arklem souverniers + bound servants.

Skeletons all booby-trapped with bombs inside of them (seed it earlier upstairs).
They can use the skeletons later on against actual threats.
Threat: Undead giant who uses his other hand as a club. TODO: rnaged threat. Hulking zombies tortles that two-hit, then drop themselves prone as an attack ontop of you for bonus dmg (on hit, both prone, adv to hit against hit enemy).
