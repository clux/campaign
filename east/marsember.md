Sells vampire adrenaline. Injection as a bonus action (if primed). Grants one extra action immediately but must make a DC20 CON save or take 1d2 levels of exhaustion. Repeat use increases DC by 5. DC resets to 20 after long night.

## Undead hospital
Mostly dealing in bone fractures.


## Heme-pires
City of self-sustaining vampires. Put in place by Irae?

## Unionised skeletons?
