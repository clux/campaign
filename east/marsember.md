Main powerhouse of the region - can be used against Nekrina later

Sells vampire adrenaline. Injection as a bonus action (if primed). Grants one extra action immediately but must make a DC20 CON save or take 1d2 levels of exhaustion. Repeat use increases DC by 5. DC resets to 20 after long night.

## Vampire Council
Government castle. Closed at day. Undead + Zombies rule at day.
Vampire, Patricians most reasonable here (noblemen turned to vampirism).
More easy for them to argue for sustainability. CC365 CR10
Perhaps a disgruntled Vampire Priestess CC367, CR8 who do not fully appreciate the new lifestyle, but her lust for revolution does not have a voice with the populus (mostly skeletons).
Personal guard on the council; Vampire Knight CC379 CR11
Zombie Lord; CC394 CR5

### Guard Dog Outside
In the mausoleum. An Ankou. Summoned by the liches to provide stability of Council. CC36.
Leading into it is a Spirit Lamp CC349 (soulless lamb holder, illuminating the path)

## Town Cries - Headless Horsemelon

## Undead hospital
Mostly dealing in bone fractures. Bones/blood from conjure woodland animals.

## NPCs
Captain of the Guards. Fierstjerren; CR5 CC157

## Undead intelligence
- Skeletons quite dumb (cow like)
- Zombie
- Ghouls bouncers
- EVERY ANIMAL, DRAGONS
- Constructs; Bone Golem CC195 CR7
- Vampires (smart)
- Liches (highest leadership, need a soul farm, angers devils)

Vampires are a bit more of a fan of fresh blood. Philosophiclaly dull to live a perfect live.
This lich is a nice guy, but spending eternity together kind of guy?

## Soul Farm
Two buildings outside the city.
Monstrosities exist within.
Elophar CR4; CC149
Kulmking CR9 CC244
Nachzehrer CR8 CC272


## Attacks on Cities
Celestials attacking? Need Gate summoning with true name?
Fallen angel might know the name of a celestial (faey knows hans)

## Heme-pires
City of self-sustaining vampires. Put in place by Irae?

## Unionised skeletons?

## A vampire city
