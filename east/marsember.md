Previously ruled by Natalya. Now a powerhouse of the Vegan

## Intro

Festival really. Stereotypical depictions of undeath. Make-up. Grey artificial hair color on vampires (who don't have to have it.)

## Dracolich
Main powerhouse of the region - can be used against centuria later

## Religion
Priestess; https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/594756694514707123/ ?
Vampire of Kiaransalee.

## Leader
Erevain Greenleaf. Elven heme-vampire. Doesn't need oxygen to breathe. Can walk to the bottom of Dragon Lake with a backpack of rocks on.

Sells vampire adrenaline. Injection as a bonus action (if primed). Grants one extra action immediately but must make a DC20 CON save or take 1d2 levels of exhaustion. Repeat use increases DC by 5. DC resets to 20 after long night.

## Undead hospital
Mostly dealing in bone fractures.


## Heme-pires
City of self-sustaining vampires. Put in place by Irae?

## Unionised skeletons?

## A vampire city
