# Nekrina

![](nekrina.png)
Legacy empire at Darkhold (on sword coast map).

## History
Old trade route to the falled Cormyr/Sembian empire about 500 years ago.
Formerly maintained by dwarves at that time.
In recent times; mostly a settlement for centaurs/griffins, other classically magical creatures that found it difficult to fit in with major cities built for humanoids.
Currently; These powers bought by coin from Hell (whitewashed through baldur's gate), and adventuring parties have joined in.

### Dwarven Times
A powerful dwarven empire had its roots here, most connected cities disappeared with the netherese.
Now the resting place of Akkhan. Overrun with underdark creatures and driders. At the time, the city was called `Dhirn Darim`, but centaurs named it `Nekrina` much later.

## Description
Enormous sand pyramid rises up along the mountain side with beautifully carved small but plentiful steps mostly covered in sand. Centaurs talking amongst themselves under one leader (real beefy fuckers with huge bows, clearly battle trained, talking in a regimented fashion). Multiple griffins perched half way up the stairs.
Several parties of armored humans helping out carrying equipment up the sand covered stairs.

Kind of in the middle of it you spot about 5 humanoids in fancier gear.
Two male humanoids (Grigor, Isaak), 1 tiefling (Dorfirith), one two elves(ish) (Muelara, Zaehesh).

The elves are both very cute looking. One with great flowing blue hair in a white robe that seems completely unsullied from the sand and mud you saw earlier. The other seems to have some kind enchantment on her large red hair (flowing wildly upwards), and metal face plates around it, and hefty metal armor.

Been fighting together for a long time. Level 11. Helped clear Baldur's Gate of cultists from Baal.

##### Izák Slezák
Isaak is pretty "cool" a bit "try hard". Tosses his hair around.
- "So, you're the big shots from up north huh?"
- "I heard you tore the prince of demons a fresh one."
- "You looking for a hand on your mission? I doubt I could find a better crew than you."

##### Zhan Ling
Zhan is a cleric of `Bane`. The aristocracy in Baldur's Gate is a bit oppressive.
Uses a maul, very skillfully. Like an asian monk. Will greet GW respectfully. Uncle Roger accent.
- "You use ancient hammer?"
- "Ancient hammer, only for skilled warria."
- "Be one with the hammaa."
- "You beat uncle Zhan in fight to death, and uncle Zhan, join party."
- "Oh, you no kill uncle Zhan. uncle Zhan too good."
- "Oh, I won't kill you. I'll stop just before."
- "FIGHT TO THE DEATH."

Will challenge GW to Bellow/Flumph. Failed.

### Talindra + Lyeneru Morren
Sisters, but Talindra is a thiefling. Great grandfather on mother's side apparently had infernal roots.
Following the standard approach, her sister has tried to do her hair up in such a way to cover her horns, but it's large and extrudes far to the side. They took this job here because only limeted combat experience was required (magic knowledge nice to have).
Lyeneru is a high elf that knows some magic. But Talindra just took a warlock pact via Zaehesh with Mephisto.
Level 3, just learning the ropes.
