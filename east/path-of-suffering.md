# Path of Suffering
Passage through the Shadowfell. Shadowfell might be its own can of worms, but that's normal (they can't monitor that area that well).

At the peak, if they are lost, they can meet [[dessirris]] who will advocate from the celestials to take on undead.

Path have to lead a winding path around a mountain, around ancient burial grounds. You'll know you're on the right path if you see the mist forming along the path.

Pass a few Shadar-Kai on the way out. Emissaries from Dorian, asking the Celerom to proceed with his experiment and bring forth samples.
- Surprise: "Are you here to end my path, or do you willingly wish enter the path of suffering?"
- Advice: "Stay on path, friend. The city might be gloomy, but spirits lingering outside, can be much worse. Oh, and be quiet on the bridge." (Warns of sorrowsworn in the wild MTOF231++ and a big beast under the bridge)
- Overview: "A forsaken place. Undeath and lingering spirits stand on every corner. A few of us are continually spared."
- He?: "I am one of the few entrusted by the raven queen with a mission, in doing so I can bring back food for the village."

### Irae Encounter
Path sends you through a valley, foot prints visible, mist starting to form at your feet. You are clearly high up in this mountain.

helpers: 2 vampire spawn (dim servant high schoolers), 8 will o wisps.
halucinatory terrain plus helpers undead above the valley and there's mist above uneven ground. She doesn't care for a fight here, at most a few rounds.
Protections: Mind Blank, Crown of Stars, invis at will, shield up, counterspell.
If attacked; arcane deflection reac, 19-23AC depending on conc/deflect + deals dmg.
If they attack, just add maddening darkness, fly up away while undead attacks.

Irae (all cases): It's time we had a chat together. You have caused quite the disruption at Halos.
Irae (demon lord defense): Well, that was ultimately a distraction until I got all the pieces together. You see, it's with all the artifacts of Kiaransalee combined that the raised dead retain their souls and sentience.
Irae (undead sentience defense): You fail to understand the true significance of this event? It's all undead raised from this point by me, or anyone I have raised. This is an infectious proprety. Souls are no longer sent off to hell in eternal torment to serve as infernal currency, nor are a small percentage sent to elysium, where they can enjoy this.. distinct position of privilege. They are free. They are immortal. All it took was to crash the economy of souls.
Irae (giant mind control defense): I offered Umnos power, and he took it. I'm sure he's not the only one who's learning to read the fine print.
Irae (giant justification): Chaos was a necessary agent to get at 3 very protected pieces. Society was either too un-budging, or too brutish to be able to deal with my proposal. Some plans are so great, that you can only effectively argue for it once it's been placed into effect.
Irae (in case of Bone City retreat / shadowfell escape): I think it's best you try to stop what you are doing.
Extraplanar: Sure, there is going to be resistance.

Small village of shadar-kai (closed ecosystem for vampires to harvest) Manasari, about 200 people. They know they cannot leave their land or they'll choke on the mist. They recycle souls on death. Superstitious. Raven Queen occasionally smiles on the most worthy and lets us leave this place.

## Shadowfell madness
Play on their weaknesses. Sins they have committed. Play on it. Dante. 1408

Where would the Negative Versions of Yourselves lead you?
They need a NPC guide?
Maybe the amount of challenges they complete dictate results at final one?
More and more exhaustion if they fail.

**Foreshadowing encounter when resting in a hotel**:
In a window (1408), you see a creature. Dimly lit, staring at you through an opposing window. As you look towards it, it appears to look at you, and as you shift from side to side, so does it.
 If you pick up a light, you see who it is (You, staring towards you), but you also see another creature behind it charging up towards you. If reaction of them is to turn, they are NOT surprised.
