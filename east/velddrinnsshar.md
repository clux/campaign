City in the centre of the Moondeep Sea (AKA beneath Lake of Dragons in Cormyr in my setting).

TODO: island on the Lake of Dragons, sheer drop tunnel down.
(flying carpet perhaps)
st michael's mount style island in the middle of the lake. Glorious perched atop?
Perhaps the black marble temple is atop?
Perhaps some light/dark symbolism?
Actually only available in the shadowfell.

## Ashes of Ariandel
Base on Ashes of Ariandel DS3.
Acropolis in shadowfell.
-  Tower with bowman; Siege weapon like bowman causing havoc.
-  Millwood knights (proper fighters from the past)

In the past? Initially, where they can meet young Irae? Not really the past, but a painted world / demiplane.
They can get clues about backstory, and then guardians of time stopping them from fucking up the past?

Really don't ahve to base it so hard on that look though, just the geeral idea.

## Acropolis of Thanatos
A black marble temple. A temple devoted to the worship of the goddess [[kiaransalee]].

Stood in a lake-filled cavern with its ceiling covered with thousands of skulls, atop a spire of white stone that held a set of spiraling stairs guarded by boneclaws.

A brooding block of black marble veined with red, filled with misshapen corridors, windows, and gaping doorways. Many of the stairs trickled with what seemed to be rancid fat and many of the rooms had their walls covered in murals depicting gruesome scenes painted with dried blood.

Take some inspiration from Arach-Tinilith.
