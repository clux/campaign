City in the centre of the Moondeep Sea (AKA beneath Lake of Dragons in Cormyr in my setting).

They have to pass through a vortex during a storm to get to the shadowfell portal.

## City
Drow style city. But with undead creatures building.

### Encounters
#### Harpooning "The Lonely" which then calls in a Drider
Off the beaten path encounter (graveyard?)
The drider will lower its weapon if they are close to killing it.
#### Ceiling Spiders & Dracoliches
For an aerial approach across the ceiling.
Spider is actually Arachnomancers
Dracoliches are immune to charm/frighten/paralyze/poisoned, immune to poison.
Dracoliches have adv on saves, res to necrotic.
Adult Black (say).

#### Irae in the City
Spectacular leader style.
- "thank you, thank you. now you know today is a big day."
- "we stand here at the moment of creation, at the cusp of our victory"
- "the conversion of the final ancient draws to a close, and with it, our time of confinement"
- "we will be reunited with our lost ones once again"
- "lolth will regret intercede in our affairs"
- "menzo will be ours"
- "from the halls of undermountain, waterdeep will be swallowed up?"


### Entertainment
#### Drider bowl
mutant driders crossed with demons (champions taken from prisons in menzo)
now fight for glory. bets on the beefy ones.
winner enter draw to get to reshuffle the bones of old pip (failed medical student now undead)


### Library of the Dead
Run by Madame Eithne
- Will let you read books if you give her a scroll of Ceremony (to cast a funeral rite)
- Otherwise they have to

Books about histories of famous people. Biographies, literal ghostwriter.
- Shadowmantle; book about an unseelie moon elf who rose to become the overwizard of the Tower Arcane around 800DR in [[luskan]]. The book follows her from 1100 to 1102 as she had taken residence in [[evernight]] working on creating phylacteries for dragons. (Dracoliches). Ghostwritten by Edvard Feeler (high-functioning autist demilich who made black tentacle spell)
- ~~Greeth; another ghostwritten biography of the archmage of the arcane brothehood, his rise to power, and an extraordinary ruse~~

### High End Cemetery
Big mausoleums and tombs on a hill. Where the more noble undead can rest.

### Security
Zombie tank from L4D2 (reskinned fire giant with 29str, single attacks)
Drow shadowblade MTOF 187 CR11 (melee defense squads)
Drow inquisitor (to detect lies) CR14 MTOF184 (white out eyes, whispers to shadowblades)
Driders scanning unusual areas.
Arachnomancer (faerie fire, giant spider)

### Religion
#### Temple to Ilhares Alur and Kiaranslee.
Temple entrance shaped like two grasping hands, top hand with silver ringed fingers, into a spherical chamber standing on almost a stilt in the ground. Hands above ground, req levitate.
Matron Shi'nayne Mizzrym
Looks: big stiff leather black cloak that contains these bent flaps that form an outline around her ears and joining at her forhead) where there's a purple gemstone embedded. Long, super thick white mane of hair, pulled back, and two thin long horns protrude behind the leather face rectangle. (or just silk weave dress as in book...)
Has a retriever (large construct spider CR14)
High perception. Likely to detect them if undercover.
Will fight for Kiaransalee, and accept her fate as part of Kiaransalee's chosen.

### Economy
War. Undead has no food needs. Drow has magic. Undead wants to reunite. Drow wants to conquer.
Theocracy masquerading as Noocracy.

### Philosophy
Drow there for a kinder society after the tyranny of Lolth. Worshippers of Eilistraee there even.
Also Menzo got pretty wrecked by demon lords (portal right there).



### NPC: Madame Clementine; Elegant Night Hag of the Avarie
https://www.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/nvosx6/art_madame_cl%C3%A9mentine_night_hag_of_avarie/
she runs a guild for aspiring drow mages, she's in fact a warlock patron for some of them
after riches and has a small mansion to the side.
stats: beef up a night hag. elder night hag. baba lysaga?
why?
- killing her will soften resistance
- she's respected and will have information (lore books)


## History
The Crones obtained a voidstone, and placed it within the Acropolis in order to sustain a gate to the Shadowfell, to summon an army of undead.

## NPC: Antoine Lastfever
broken french accent. no h sound. uvular r (back of throat), dark l. last syllable weight.
what does he want?



## Hazards / Environment
### Protection
Necrotic Tempest raging around path to temple. DC15 CON save every minute vs 3d6 necro dmg.
Instate it along with the DS3 entrance fight to spice it up.

### Death
If you die here, you immediately become an undead servant or a mane/dretch/rutterkin. You can only be reverted back via raise dead/wish/resurrection polymorph.

### Miniboss High AC Undead Champion
Red visor eyes, huge sword.
Enters with sword dropping from the skies first in city, then he's dropped from an undead griffin. Make him fly glide above ground as to unnaturally move.

### Sorcer Relics
Spider familiar tracking them.
### Sleeping
Dream Wraiths. CC135 CR5

### Fights
- Four Kings fight (Close combat darkness fight ala DS1)

#### Enemies
- Flying Polyp CR11 CC162
- Ghost Dragon CR11 CC170
- Ghost Dwarf CR6 CC171
- Many Ghoul variants in CC172...
- Bloog Giants CR8 CC180 (great snipers + obscurers - tactical + they know them)
- Gloomflowers CC188 CR3 (good for triggering visions)
- Doom Golem CC197 CR10
- Skull Lord MTF 230 CR15

## Inspiration
### Floating Netherese City; Thultanthar
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WX3Mj5kkuuI
Ulrant's Guide to the planes of the Shadowfell - 25$
Flying fortress, raining rocks as foreshadowing (flies above you)

### Ashes of Ariandel; Acropolios in Shadowfell
-  Tower with bowman; Siege weapon like bowman causing havoc.
-  Millwood knights (proper fighters from the past - revived by [[arklem]] over centuries

In the past? Initially, where they can meet young Irae? Not really the past, but a painted world / demiplane.
They can get clues about backstory, and then guardians of time stopping them from fucking up the past?

Really don't ahve to base it so hard on that look though, just the geeral idea.

### Auril's Temple trials
P208 rime of frostmaiden
Blessing of Kiaransalee; Immunity to Necrotic on DC22 CON SAVE.
