City in the centre of the Moondeep Sea (AKA beneath Lake of Dragons in Cormyr in my setting).

They have to pass through a vortex during a storm to get to the shadowfell portal.

Other path from [[irithyll]] two way teleport to below.

Can do a big undead city.. City of Seyna map..

## Acropolis of Thanatos
A black marble temple. A temple devoted to the worship of the [[kiaransalee]].

Stood in a lake-filled cavern with its ceiling covered with thousands of skulls, atop a spire of white stone that held a set of spiraling stairs guarded by boneclaws.

A brooding block of black marble veined with red, filled with misshapen corridors, windows, and gaping doorways. Many of the stairs trickled with what seemed to be rancid fat and many of the rooms had their walls covered in murals depicting gruesome scenes painted with dried blood.

Take some inspiration from Arach-Tinilith.
https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Arach-Tinilith

Pyramid like paths. Green flame water ways.

### Central Chamber
![](shar-chamber.jpg)
Where Irae tries to revive [[kiaransalee]] using the second egg of [[felgolos]].

### Her chamber
At the top. Room with info on plans.
Also got a teleport circle, can go to Maerimydra.
Arklem can port there.

## History
The Crones obtained a voidstone, and placed it within the Acropolis in order to sustain a gate to the Shadowfell, to summon an army of undead.

## Hazards / Environment
### Ward Spell
`Guards and Wards` spell (vs non-undead / all with password: vertebrazen).
Fog filled corridors, strong illusion towards wrong directions (hard to interpret).
Stairs with Web everywhere.
Arcane Lock on all doors.
Then:
2x Stinking Clouds or 2x Magic Mouth (invitations to doom rooms)
## Protection
Necrotic Tempest raging around path to temple. DC15 CON save every minute vs 3d6 necro dmg.
Instate it along with the DS3 entrance fight to spice it up.

### Sorcer Relics
Spider familiar tracking them.
### Sleeping
Dream Wraiths. CC135 CR5

### Fights
- Four Kings fight (Close combat darkness fight ala DS1)

#### Enemies
- Flying Polyp CR11 CC162
- Ghost Dragon CR11 CC170
- Ghost Dwarf CR6 CC171
- Many Ghoul variants in CC172...
- Bloog Giants CR8 CC180 (great snipers + obscurers - tactical + they know them)
- Gloomflowers CC188 CR3 (good for triggering visions)
- Doom Golem CC197 CR10
- Skull Lord MTF 230 CR15

## Felgolos rescue
[[felgolos]] could become drained to become a dracolich.
If this happens, he has 30 days.
He will try to contact them when they are on the same plane of existence.

Otherwise he plots the steal of the other egg.

## Inspiration
### Floating Netherese City; Thultanthar

Ulrant's Guide to the planes of the Shadowfell - 25$
Flying fortress, raining rocks as foreshadowing (flies above you)

### Ashes of Ariandel; Acropolios in Shadowfell
-  Tower with bowman; Siege weapon like bowman causing havoc.
-  Millwood knights (proper fighters from the past - revived by [[arklem]] over centuries

In the past? Initially, where they can meet young Irae? Not really the past, but a painted world / demiplane.
They can get clues about backstory, and then guardians of time stopping them from fucking up the past?

Really don't ahve to base it so hard on that look though, just the geeral idea.

### Auril's Temple trials
P208 rime of frostmaiden
Blessing of Kiaransalee; Immunity to Necrotic on DC22 CON SAVE.
