## Waterdeep Outpost
Thieves guild / jarlaxle's mercenary hideout. 100 active in waterdeep at a time, but probably only 30 in various parts of the guild at a time. Screwed halfway between the sewers and the mountain. Quick escapes, but front is a façade. A shop of items. "Swords from luskan." Largely unpopular, but that's just a ruse. Everyone who knows about it must go through "initiation".

## One Eyed Jax
https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/One-Eyed_Jax
Beniago's purple bird immediately kaws as you enter.

See [[beniago]] for the intro. He is operating a ship for Kurth. Badass.
See https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Beniago under Ship Kurth for favourable hiring of ships.

### Lines
- We have many members who know the trade and are experienced shoppers.
- We'd need to see that you are game and now how to business.
- Go to Diamond Street corner in the evening and talk to the long haired guard, he'll find you a seller.

### Luskan Quests
Via [[beniago]].
So, you're clearly pretty thieves already, but you haven't technically accomplished any tasks for us, so I will give you a freebie. We will grant you Swashbuckler rank if;
- Get Orena + Zanu drunk.

Drinking contest / deception / magic.

#### Alternate Short quest
Steal something pointless from the captain.

#### Long quest 2
Wants you to retrieve Araushnee's Stinger +3 dagger of Venom.

Defended by 2x Monolith Champions. Some of the most powerful constructs that we've seen. Anyone we've sent in has been dispatched with a blue flamed blade and our attacks might have pierced its armor, but after being hit, one of our mercenaries turned against us.

Beniago: "It's been hard to find people stupid enough to go in after that. Now, I realize I'm not making perhaps the most persuasive argument. But hear me out; my point is that we've seen you embark on quests most people have found foolish, and you've come out superior."

Keep what's in there. Quest for Faeynore? Drawings of Lolth.

Base dungeon on Dark Heart http://www.wizards.com/files/157_Dark_Heart.pdf - goes into the feywild post the obvious fake shrine parts.

Reward
More access to items!
Sell hit squads for N-thousand gold, depending on difficulty.

#### Final Long Quest
Find and recover main kidnapped leader + item in Menzo.
Or perhaps ruathym?

#### EBA Quest
Steal item from Mages Guild to frame someone. (Stealing totally bad idea against scrying mage).
If they get caught, he will add a parasite into the skull of the caught thief. -4 INT until removed + clairvoyance info. Want Cat Ear Headband stolen.
Alternatively, steal a ring and frame another ship?

### Initiation Quest
Steal javelin from Gideon

OR:
They'll meet Brian(fake name) and he'll give you the password to the guild.

#### Initiation Heist
Cobbled streets around a mansion. Tall, three story house on other side of narrow cobbled street. Belongs to commoners. Mansion has walls that are hard to climb while being stealthy. No obvious holes in wall. Backside has guards visible. Guards on patrol very slowly. Gate is locked. Two more villas to the right of the main one.

#### Challenges
Avoiding guards. Two downstairs. (Climb window stealthily).
Take out guards. Fast takedown or more appear.

#### Gideon
Sleeping. Can be woken up. Annoying noble. Superiority, but nothing evil about him.
"well of course they complain, not everyone can be in charge of policies, and in times of decline, the sellers of the most superfluous goods always suffer first."
Sleeping in the room with the rake?

### #If they get caught
They will have valuables stolen from them and they'll be locked away in chamber. And they'll have to escape.

Escape will be a dungeon where they are meant to rot, but end up having to break out inside castle waterdeep.
Or they can break locks to go back into thieves guild and find storage area. Where they can find all their loot along with tons of misc weaponry.

Inner: minor garden, window to kitchen. 2 guards in entranceway.
Standard Merchant Prince's Villa map from TOA.

#### Alternate version
They ask around first, and one of them tells them:
"if you are game, you can prove yourself by doing some shopping for us."
"one of the lords, Aveyron, has a javelin on his wall in his upstairs library that we'd like to buy, unfortunately, he's been very busy lately, and almost impossible to reach."
"we'd recommend you wait for him outside, and make a deal with him, if you know what I mean."

Once inside stealth the way through.

### More quest ideas
- Steal quests.
- Create a heist.
- Steal from famous people. Magisters.
