# Silver Helix
An ancient organisation with ties to the `Emerald Enclave`.

## Rumors
"their word faded from the word of mouth as the effects of the sundering, and the fall of the netherese empire came and went, without any accellerating global deterioration, but their leaders still maintain the organisation, operated out of Gulthmere, below the sea of fallen stars".

## Overview
> goal: destroy/distort the information about ancient undead powers, so that history does not repeat itself, and that power structures in the outer planes maintain their balance.
> members: high ranking champions of celestials, emmisaries from outer planes (hell, gehanna, ysgard, elysium, limbo), high ranking druids, one seelie court member
> stance on undead: heavily anti. lost their most powerful leader and a large part of the eastern land to an undead scourge hundreds of years ago. anything touched by undeath inevitably corrupts.
> stance on dragons: heavily in favour of; breeds them, uses them as powerful emissaries, infiltrators of high society to naturally seed trust in them as advisors and allies. the dragons' loyalties to the silver helix will inevitably yield good returns trade, and standing.
> recent goal: investigate the death of a blue dragon Chorym in Neverwinter; current insights imply undead influence, but there is also a group of adventurers who were found tampering with his hideout; motivation likely positive, but would like to clear out.
> current goal: investigate the corruption of the waters in dragon lake. undead spotted on the outskirts of Cormyr, dispatched by Zaehesh (member)

**Membership**: High level power. Understanding of planar politics, local political influence.
**Goals**: Unity among the planes; natural order to everything, they are a guiding hand towards peaceful coexistence and cooperation. Not above using subterfuge and deception to get a goal accomplished.
**Secrecy**: Trust likely to be eroded if people knew it was "arguably undermining" public free thought. They are afraid of the mages scrying eyes and as such have magic free zones. Some of them are actively met with. Diana latest from sword coast. Previously Pre-Celerom arch-mage from Arcane Brotherhood.
**Tensions**: Dhaikhezzish focus on the material planes is not universally welcomed. He has maintained many city-of-brass style ideals of what is reasonable for trade that feels outdated today. He talks a bigger game on unity when not dealing with the city. Due to its size and sphere of influence, it is often ignored.
