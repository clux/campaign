# Silver Helix
An ancient organisation with ties to the `Emerald Enclave`. Communicates infrequently, and avoids long range communication and city-to-city teleportation to avoid drawing the attention of mages guilds and nefarious powers. Sends emissaries to various cities to align.

## Rumors
- "their word faded from the word of mouth as the effects of the sundering, and the fall of the netherese empire came and went, without any accellerating global deterioration, but rumors say the organisation still persists, somewhere in Gulthmere, below the sea of fallen stars".

## Overview
> goal: destroy/distort the information about ancient undead powers, so that history does not repeat itself, and that power structures in the outer planes maintain their balance.
> members: metallic dragons, high ranking champions of celestials, emmisaries from outer planes (hell, gehanna, ysgard, elysium, limbo), high ranking druids, one seelie court member
> stance on undead: heavily anti. lost their most powerful leader and a large part of the eastern land to an undead scourge hundreds of years ago. anything touched by undeath inevitably corrupts.
> stance on dragons: heavily in favour of; breeds them, uses them as powerful emissaries, infiltrators of high society to naturally seed trust in them as advisors and allies. the dragons' loyalties to the silver helix will inevitably yield good returns trade, and standing.
> long standing goal: figure out what happened to [[felgolos]]
> recent goal: investigate the death of a blue dragon `Chorom` in Neverwinter; current insights imply undead influence, but there is also a group of adventurers who were found tampering with his hideout; motivation likely positive, but would like to clear out.
> ongoing goal: track the movement of the demon lords, learn of their origin.
> current goal: investigate the corruption of the waters in dragon lake. undead spotted on the outskirts of Cormyr, dispatched by Zaehesh

**Membership**: Planar emissaries (magnus), draconic influencers in human cities. Forged through an old unity of two metallic dragons, along with the sultan.
**Goals**: Unity among the planes; natural order to everything, they are a guiding hand towards peaceful coexistence and cooperation. Not above using subterfuge and deception to get a goal accomplished. Dhaikhezzish provides incentives to even the dragons, by granting wishes once every hundred years.
**Secrecy**: Trust likely to be eroded if people knew it was "arguably undermining" public free thought. They are afraid of the mages scrying eyes and as such have magic free zones. Some of them are indirectly met with; Diana latest from sword coast. Previously Pre-Celerom arch-mage from Arcane Brotherhood.
**Tensions**: Dhaikhezzish focus on the material planes is not universally welcomed. He has maintained many city-of-brass style ideals of what is reasonable for trade that feels outdated today. He talks a bigger game on unity when not dealing with the city. Due to its size and sphere of influence, it is often ignored.
**Tensions**: Lost alliances in Luskan, Neverwinter recently. Stormguard plant never worked out. Waterdeep always warded dragons, and mages too busy to control the city to think about continent-level problems.

## Members
Magnus Incalesco: `Dhaikhezzish The Incandescent` (sultan of the efreet from plane of fire)
Magnus Ambulos: [[Andraste]]
Magnus Arbor: `Emmantiensien` (from [[seelie-court]])
Magnus Umbra: `Melanura` (shadow fell shadar kai, been to Irithyll)
Nobilis Argentum: `Adalon` (Icewind Dale)
Nobilis Aurochalcinus: [[felgolos]] (Stormguard)
Nobilis Sapphyrus: `Chorom` (Neverwinter)
Nobilis Aurum: `Aerosclughpalar` aka Vaeros Fireshield (Baldur's Gate)

## Allies
### Waterdeep
No dragons allowed in waterdeep because of the ward.
But [[jarlaxle]] occasionally trades information about them for safe harbour of [[bregan-daerthe]].

### Luskan
`Arabeth Raurym` (pre-celerom overwizard of tower arcane, south tower) - now dead

### Neverwinter
`Chorom` - Adult Blue Dragon undercover as a wizard at the peak of [[castle-never]].

### Icewind Dale
`Adalon` (undercover Draco Nobilis Argentum). High Chancellor of Icewind Dale.
His "family" always rules, settles disputes, barbarians/goliaths somehow never attack the city. Only room for so many though, population stable for the past century. Run it like jarl's city in skyrim.
It's Adalon the 5th now. He's 1200 yo. He has vast knowledge.
He fought Arklem once when he tried to raise heroes of the city.

rumors: "Adalon is fair, knowledgable and fond of silver. You infernal better stay on your toes, eh? / Perhaps why we've never had infernals attack this region, eh?

Have kept spies around Gilgrin, Menzo, Maerimydra to check for dark ones.
Will want similar updates.
Andraste have seen an undead city made out of bone. Observed it.
Not seen any sign of liches, but the unusual undead lifespan reeks of lich magic.

### Baldurs Gate
`Aerosclughpalar` - in the form of a druid. He is seen as the socrates of baldur's gate.
Knows all the leaders, can manipulate, and can debate.
https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Aerosclughpalar

rumors: "Do not underestimate Vaeros. Despite merely running debate circles in the open, he is frequently invited to present popular viewpoints to the council."

### Stormguard
[[felgolos]] agreed to influence the giants, but he has not responded back in ages, presumed dead, or not wanting to be found.

## Knowledge
They know of Irae + Arklem, but not where they are hiding. Scrying does not work.
Adalon has seen Arklem firsthand.
They serve as first defenses against cities. Know that with dragons in place, the demon lords are going to face stiff competition => likely next target == Neverwinter.

They know about Baba Yaga.
Leader knows about the prophecy of Kiaransalee.
Adalon knows about Maerimydra and its slaughter. Wards are in place should she return. Imprisonment.
