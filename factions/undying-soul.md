# Undying Soul
Faction that worships [[kiaransalee]].

## Rumors/Lines
- "the undying soul changes everything" (liches doomed before, but now, can self-sustain)
- "they brought demon lords to toril, do you really want to fuck with them?"

## Prophecy
The aligned three avenges that which came before. They shall become the true harbingers of the long peace. Through all means necessary, the errors of the past shall be corrected, and through conflict, peace will return. So sayeth the revenancer.
> Nothing is as powerful than that which returns having avenged.

Slashes indicate translastion issues from undercommon. Peace and stability is the same word in undercommon.

## Motivation
**Goal**: Unending life, unending peace. Irae can make it happen. High ranks have power. Raise all they can. Start with the shadowfell. Mind control important people. At a certain point they will have critical mass and can start taking on the [[silver-helix]].
**Possible goal**: Have [[koth]] reclaim [[neverwinter]]. Valindra?
**Temporary goal**: Protect [[velddrinnsshar]] from party.
**Membership**: Recruitment of the best of the best by extremely secretive liches. You don't get to choose not to say yes. Geas / mind control / death are usual results.
**Organisation**: Irae + Arklem runs the show. He is the facilitator + invisible hand, she is the only one with the power to use Kiaransalee's artifacts.
**Secrecy**: Need to build the eradicator in velddrinnsshar, and amass an army big enough for it to not be stoppable.
**Tension** A lot of very powerful liches working for the same goal, all fit for leadership role. [[koth]] is not a pet on a leash, but an extremely intelligent ancient being.
