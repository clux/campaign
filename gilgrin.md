# Gilgrin
Gilgrin map verbatim.

Huge amount of hobgoblins  / goliaths pushing a flywheel. Overseen by 6 fire giants + 4 on bridge + 2 bosses upstairs.
If they stop the wheel, giants hostile. Or reinforcements come.
Feeds much of the crystal energy. Stopping the wheel



## Fortress upwards
Toilet wall inside

https://old.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/f2ps43/molten_upheaval_wall_of_lava_new_molten_lava/ - wall of lava + molten upheaval spells! 

Zoltan: Reports to Irae
Dreadnaught has the titan knuckles + two pairs of +2 shields.

Crystal is main power source (pre-powered). It powers the energy field upstairs.
Upstairs is a similar one that harnesses the energy, plus one that is dedicated (black) to maintaining demon lord portals.

Arcs: isolate them so they can be taken on similarly. Solo battle is going to be tough.
If they destroy it, they better fucking high-tail it. They might persuade him to check on the vault.

### Felogolos Kiaransalee Lore
He is old enough to know about the first rise of Kiaransalee. Knows that she fell in a mutual clash with Sunwuko and the champions Shario + Akkhan + Sunwuko + Natalya 700 years ago.

Books tell about societies fallen; in the east to the undead. All communication gone. The whole society corrupted. The empire of the netherese was wiped out due to the corruption of their citizens, not by greedy magicians.

Sunwuko a master monk ruled the City of Shade. They had developed a completely different style of fighting to combat the stun-proof elites of the undead; fast shooting weaponry.

Tells of the fighting style of Kiaransalee; magically imbued scythe. Could not be charmed, could not be stunned, and could not be transformed in any way. Attacks out of nothing (invis), and when angry.

Kiaransalee lost all her power when the hordes of her followers died in this clash. Though the last remaining champion, Shario, distributed parts of her relics to various magocracies on the coast. The Eternal Star, a diamond which in its natural form was half a meter in diameter, the pommel of her scythe. The scythe of shadow was taken to Waterdeep.

The scythe is the final part of Kiaransalee's relics. The handle was in Gilgrin, the pommel in the reliquary. But she still has to use the daemon lords to break Waterdeep to get the scythe.

### Felgolos
Rests in the middle of the lava pit.

Felgolos: Massive glossy curved wall of metal. The color is kind of a dull red. 

Tactics: Will just sleep ray everyone in combat. Place isn't big enough for him to fly. 

Wants: Freedom. But he's held hostage for his dragon eggs. Held below a passage gilgrin beneath one tower.
Initially sleepy, but wakes very easily. Will seem hostile in the first 5s. 

Deep voice. 

"Who wakes me from my slumber."
Eyes start glowing white.

if no one says anything for a while
eyes power down, "you are not with the fire giants, nor are you drow"
"curious"

Kept here his entire life. Knows a lot of magic and if they smuggle it out he can fix the elevator and go to the council in Waterdeep.
But they have to first ensure its young are escorted out. They are nursed in a nest below Gilgrin.
