# Gilgrin
Gilgrin map verbatim.

Huge amount of hobgoblins  / goliaths pushing a flywheel. Overseen by 6 fire giants + 4 on bridge + 2 bosses upstairs.
If they stop the wheel, giants hostile. Or reinforcements come.
Feeds much of the crystal energy. Stopping the wheel



## Fortress upwards
Toilet wall inside
Pass through assembly hall
Huge assembly hall. Hell hound

## Fortress top
Zoltan + Dreadnaught + Blue Crystal

https://old.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/f2ps43/molten_upheaval_wall_of_lava_new_molten_lava/ - wall of lava + molten upheaval spells! 

Zoltan: Reports to Irae
Dreadnaught has the titan knuckles + two pairs of +2 shields.

Crystal is main power source (pre-powered). It powers the energy field upstairs.
Upstairs is a similar one that harnesses the energy, plus one that is dedicated (black) to maintaining demon lord portals.

Arcs: isolate them so they can be taken on similarly. Solo battle is going to be tough.
If they destroy it, they better fucking high-tail it. They might persuade him to check on the vault.


## Vault
### Inside
Using https://old.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/aog16x/ocartthe_biggest_dungeon_multilayered_with_mixed/

Old dwarven mine. Taken over. Zoltan uses mind controlled duergar as slaves.

They arrive in through the middle. Straight across is Felgolos - doors locked. Need to barge in to top right door (brekable), fly up in middle, get into locked.

Final altar on the top left contains the Hammer. Unlooted. That's where the giants normally smite, but Umnos uses the dragons abilities
Seal off lower left.

Some of the best loot is in the side-rooms on the top right.

#### Bottom left: desecrated dwarf
Destroyed, almost pulverized parts of a dwarven corpse. Room sealed. Statue of Moradin. Skull intact (can let them locate Whelm).

Hammer of thunder lodged in the statue of Mordain.

LORE: Originally crafted here, but "cursed" in Gauntlgrym (via that one named evil dwarf - Grymin). Now shackled to a the center of a giant statue.
Door sealed. Sense magic emanating.
Hammer of Thunder (needs >20 str - can get Manual from felgolos / frostburn on markis, or king for fire belt, or luskan jax for a 21 belt)
Manual of Bodily Health

Sealed off at construction time as best they could to seal the most evil dwarven weapon off. However, smaller corridors still somewhat accessible (if willing to take lava damage).

##### Bottom left small rooms
iron ingots, supplies, mostly abandoned.
library, dusted over, used to be place of worship for Moradin.
books; one about Akkhan, large dwarf who served as a king 600 years ago and was a champion of Kavaki.

#### Top Left: Entrance hall
Main doors locked, requires like 25+ athletics to break down, but more feasible. Deadbolt on other side.

#### Top left small rooms
Felgolos sometimes wander these hallways, and he has repurposed a shrine to Bahamut (good metalic dragon good history 15, as opposed to tiamat worshipped by chromatic dragons). Taking it would not sit well with Felgolos if noticed (will not want to leave without it, and will try to cast locate object).

Leftover materials, large amounts of food summoned here for felgolos. Construct wanders the hall and guards it; Iron Golem CR16.

Room with red; smaller anvils. Used to do tweaks and smaller weaponry. Iron ore and steel ingots.

Books; about famous dragons in the world. Written 800 years ago.
Talks about Fryggt a young white dragon adopted at birth by giants as peace offering from the dwarves. Talks about Galadaeros a copper dragon of age 100 (who was sometimes in Waterdeep) who gave birth to at the time to Felgolos. Felgolos was watched over by the Arcane Brotherhood in Luskan and has since disappeared and not been seen since. Talks about a two ancient dragons past, a blue and green dragons who resided together, unusually, in the east. Had two babies, one killed, the other lost. Also mentions notable adult guardians at the time. An ancient blue dragon in Neverwinter.

#### Top Left: Dwarven Forge
Now used by giants. A statue sits resting on the floor. The altar is a Golem, Altar Flame (beefed up). Asks for password when users take weapons near door. Will bullrush down the corridorand breathe fire as he runs to one side.

In forges on left, 3 weapons, just lacking a few finishing touches to the hilt sit hardened and polished.

+3 Cleaver Greataxe 1d12 (lets you hit everyone in a 5ft reach in 30ft line - roll to hit against each - but this is an entire action including movement). Needs a 1000gp ruby + 5th level enchantment to activate.

+3 Two Handed Flail 2d6 (Golden Scourge - Divine Smite bounces 10 feet to up to 3 additional creatures) - an attempt to recreate Akkhan's weapon. Needs a 5th level radiant damage spell imbued plus the soul of Akkhan / 1000gp opal. Needs 21 strength.

+3 Greatsword 2d6 (Aegis Fang - Cast fireball on self on crit) - needs 21 STR - no attunement - needs 5th level evocation spell cast into it along with a 1000gp topaz.

(NB: must cast every day for a month unless upping spell level and gem level)
(NB: felgolos normally does this in exchange for visitation rights)

#### CENTER: Felgolos
Rests in the middle of the lava pit, covers large sprawling surface, tail, in the lava / across closed lava acqueduct.

Felgolos: Massive glossy curved wall of metal. The color is kind of a dull red, yellowy.
Tactics: Will just sleep ray everyone in combat. Place isn't big enough for him to fly. 

Wants: Freedom now. He voluntarily sacrificed himself to be a guardian of the place, he's engineered many of the setups, and lets giants in, until recently. He has not heard from his eggs in ages, and his lair is now his tomb.

Sacrifice deal: Oversee his offspring and spread them far and wide, and get them into different societies across the continent (5 succeeded, 3 five years ago unknown) He will rest in the cozy lair herein, with access to all knowledge requested, a forge for experimentation (enjoys this)

Eggs: last remaining one transformed ia passage in gilgrin beneath one tower (guarded by fire giants, occasionally an assistant mage (just in it for the money) is coating an egg (in volcanic rock, hardening in lava). Eggs are harnessed for their magical potential and are used as the crystal orbs.
Layout: Small lab in a purple worm lair. Desk. Pulley with diamond tether lowers it into lava periodically when it flashes.


##### Felgolos Intro:
Deep mercer voice. Authoritarian leader type, not very monstery.
Eyes start glowing white, steam starts to flow from them.

"This? This is what you send? WHERE ARE THEY?"
"What have you DONE to them?"

"State. Your business."

appeasing -> steam fades, eyes stop glowing white, and you now see his normal, but still gargantuan reptilian eyes looking at you. small smile forming at mouth?

bailing -> polymorph follow them: "you think i am bound by this chamber?"

"tell me, have you seen my children?" - chult (Baratathlaer), zemnia (Ilnezhara), netherese (Pocyr) - 3 unnamed ones from last batch

History: roamed the world in his 100s, saw the rise and fall of Kiaransalee.
Attended funeral of Akkhan. Knows 3 others disappeared and performed a sacrifice.

"find my children, they should have hatched by now"
"well, neither zoltan nor umnos have not answered my requests as of late" (persuasion)

more tricksy voice in polymorphed humanoid form (faceless one style, yellow robe, white mask) [uses name el-golo]

### Felogolos Kiaransalee Lore
He is old enough to know about the first rise of Kiaransalee. Knows that she fell in Aruanoch in a mutual clash with Sunwuko and the champions Shario + Akkhan + Sunwuko + Natalya 700 years ago. He has Shario's bracers + Akkhan's ring. Some of Sharia's loot is in Halos.

Books tell about societies fallen; in the east to the undead. All communication gone. The whole society corrupted. The empire of the netherese was wiped out due to the corruption of their citizens, not by greedy magicians.

Sunwuko a master monk ruled the City of Shade. They had developed a completely different style of fighting to combat the stun-proof elites of the undead; fast shooting weaponry (auto-reload crossbows).

Tells of the fighting style of Kiaransalee; magically imbued scythe. Could not be charmed, could not be stunned, and could not be transformed in any way. Attacks out of nothing (invis), and when angry.

Kiaransalee lost all her power when the hordes of her followers died in this clash (Helm Rift above the acropolis). Though the last remaining champion, Shario, distributed parts of her relics to various magocracies on the coast. The Eternal Star, a diamond which in its natural form was half a meter in diameter, the pommel of her scythe. The scythe of shadow was taken to Waterdeep.

The scythe is the final part of Kiaransalee's relics in Waterdeep. The handle was in Gilgrin, the pommel in the Luskan. But she still has to use the daemon lords to break Waterdeep to get the scythe.

### Felgolos Items
Shario's Bracers of Evocation (Boosts Evocation Spells, extra dmg dice to all spells of level > 0)
Ring of Comdemnation (Can cast Comdemn 30ft radius con save vs 8d8 radiant dmg as an action once per day)

Kept here his entire life. Knows a lot of magic, he can help activate magic weapons, if they can smuggle him out with the last egg.
He cannot leave this place unless they destroy the binding magic set up in the library in lower left.

Stay in this chamber (Annam's Anvil), and can imbue base weapons with fire (for the plus one extra boost up to plus 3), and can polymorph into things. Wants to disguise as a yellow robed wanderer with the faceless white mask.

#### Lower Right: Library
Large spinning set of spheres, looks a mix between astronomical and magical. The three moons of toril spinning around, but you can tell they are creating some kind of force magic. Modified Mytholabe (force dmg over radiant, extra dice, force fields, not jabs). Must be destroyed to end forcefield. Old library in disarray. The labe has completely wrecked all books and the rest of this room.

If they do it, and were detected earlier, they have to fight Zoltan and his meat shield on the way out. But if they destroyed the crystal then Felgy can help.

#### Lower Right: Small rooms
In tact remnants of old dwarven parts. Akkhan had a room here. Hidden room in the back (behind what's not actually a pentagram). Within is a gemstone for Whelm. Moonstone 1000gp (extract aspects).

Moonstone can be used to talk to Kavaki. GW sees it light up in green (whisper). Like Cadeuces good, but with colors around illusions. Green very yes. Red, very no. Purple, mostly no, teal, mostly yes.

#### Top Right: Gravekeeper Guardians + Irae protection
Irae looted parts of Kiaransalee's relics here, and left the room cursed.
Statue to the Magnificent Matriarch (Quenthil Baenrae)
But as soon as they step past the middle or start looting corpses, touching doors/buttons she will trigger and turn into a bone golemn.
Undead fight in this room. Gravekeeper giant statue comes alive. 2-phase giant fight that summons undead. 200 HP giant. First 100HP, then she will fall to her knees, summon fires within and start the waves.


Summons 4 ogre zombies per round (from each row)
Top 4 chests looks heavily looted. But does have 2 scraps:

Bracers of Archery (coz whatever)
Cloak of Displacement (probably better in reliquary)
Iridium Galvanizer

### Top Right: Tombs
+3 Radiant Glaive 1d10 (boosts yourself STR modifier worth of temp hp - without misses against undead) - https://favpng.com/png_view/weapon-glaive-pole-weapon-guandao-blade-png/4qtN5R0i

Main tomb champion who stole from Shario.

Uroum Emberbeard
Wand of Fireballs


### Entrance
in the back
4 fire giants in the path. (Throw lava etc.)
Maybe Ring Servants CC318 as guardians within
