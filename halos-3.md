## Entrance

Big FU on door?

## Umnos
No larger than a regular giant.
Huge bulging blue muscles and black energy swirling inside of him. large golden cumberbud (belt).
Blue light emits from his jaw, eyes, and it crackles from his hair (huge, windswept, crazy, even eyebrows and beard follows this style). Very Zeusy.

### Motivation
Allied with Irae. Sword now in a perfect symbiotic relationship with him. Irae has infused the sword with properties akin to Blackrazor.

LVL 18 GIANT BARBARIAN RIDING A AN ANCIENT WHITE DRAGONG.
Fryggt.

Bless them with fear immunity before / Heroes' Feast. (avoid frightful presence). Identify everything.
Cold resistance somehow?

Items:
- Belt of Giantkind: +2 CON. Advantage on intimadation checks. Resistance against lightning and fire damage.
- Blackrazor: 2d6 necro +13 LG (2 attacks)

### Core stats
Damage is necrotic 2d6 and bonus is lightning +13. Crits are 5d6 + 13.
Cold resistance. LG/Thunder immunity. Initiative adv.
Chance to come back many times. Relentless Rage DC10 +5n.
Str checks never less than 30 (indomitable might).

### Stage 1
Attacks split between Fryggt and Umnos. FU.
Mounted combatant: adv against unmounted. Can force attacks to target mount rather than you (homebrew, ignore the dex benefit).
Otherwise will simply ride the dragon, take off when lightning is full and breathe down.

Legendary action:
- Sentinel attack if dragon targetted in melee.

### Stage 2
Off dragon, kill it to absorb temp hp in one round. => 300hp
Big fucking deal. Energy funneling off dragon, leaving it a stripped carcass. Takes a round.
=> Advantage on all checks.

Legendary actions:
- rage (+4 necro dmg) - ignore resistance, reckless (adv to hit)
- Storm aura (20ft, WIS save DC21 vs d6 lg dmg)
- Sentinel; opportunity speed disable (provoke opportunity even if disengaging)

Haste as enrage; 3 attacks.

## Spire
Contains final crystal. Prismatic wall (30 foot sphere around it - repeat cast with the power of the spine at full power).
She can be inside the prismatic wall with it and use Dominate Monster on Umnos.
Door up to Umnos is heavily guarded and no one can actually enter.

## Exit (Kavaki)
Path up the tree. Spectral form simply asking goatweaver to "come with me".
At the top of the tree, he's in Ysgard.

A large spectral goliath is there, two large horns curling half a rotation around the side of his head, but somehow, he ends up looking less like a fiend, but rather more cute. You don't know him, but he looks at you with a big smile.
Kavaki is a ascended Barbarian (Grog style).

Wearing big green vestments that are too big for him (not closing properly).
Uh. Hi. I don't usually do this. But you've been really good.
(he has to do this so he can maintain godhood, otherwise fades into obscurity)

oh, (excited) dressed for the occasion, wouldn't want to be sending the wrong message, with the ol' sight and all.

Welcome to your arisening. I've you've been doing real well, uh, i mean, you've been smashing things really hard lately. (oh, this sounded so much better earlier).

Well, you see. I am actually a really good god. I don't even have to try very hard, that's how good I am. I was the strongest Goliath in goat master tribe of redwater. I smashed things so hard, they called me the ram. No one else smashed as hard, even when I was near, I heard them calling my name. It made me even stronger.
(One of the next leaders actually went on to save the world, and it was the best thing. He attributed it all to me, and I've been able to pick and choose my favourite goliaths ever since. Akkhan.)
(Now they call me their creator, just because I helped the tribe when I was younger.)

Anyway. And you have reached a critical threashold of paladineosis/paladiniusness you've become a real palagorn, and as much must retrieve your reward.
To my most devout goatlings, (with the best name, i knew from birth that you were going to be special, i had already chosen).

But it time. You have proven yourself worthy of my powers. I will grant you a portion of my powers. But in return, you must save the world, and spread the good word of me, Kavaki. So that the legacy can live on. Also, I still need followers so I can stay here.

## Exit (Mordai)
See a specral jackal headed figure standing behind your parental figures. The ones you have not seen in years. The figure slices through your parents, but they retain their smiles. But as he does, a winged figure from the heavens descends and sends a beam of white energy towards the jackall. His power over you, is no more. You are favoured by the gods, do not forget it. You see the what's left of the jackal (his spectral form filled with burn marks) begrudgingly look at you. "You have served me well. You have earned your powers."
(see into his eyes and you can see his powers, and he dislikes it).

-> find familiar must be one of the standard from the spell list (no imp)
-> eldritch blast gains the 17th level ability
-> cannot take another level in warlock

alternatively, find familiar starts malfunctioning (up to pit fiend)

maybe he can choose to fight it or not.
solar would like like to gift something, but you would have to leave this dark creature from gehanna; then have to battle it 1v1 / solar does it.
solar: "according to elysial rule, i cannot gift you this..."

TODO: no solar. owning fiend is the god!
goals of a fiend? provided giant souls. time magic could also help devils.?
mordai lends book to guy in luskan, but celerom then sows the idea in the mind of the human to dig into chronomancy. could cause to reverse some decision that didn't benefit the fiend...something..
machination by fiend.

## Exit (Faey)
Portal leading to a path outside where the weather is serene. Pass by a house with purple flowers and light. https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/312859505366843177/

Hans standing there? Seelie court?
TODO: ask Faey for information on how he would like to ascend?
12 monk subclass way of the shadow
will be 3 rogue: assassin
utilitarian
protect the feywild, keep the balance (nature good/evil circle of life)
sunwuko faey god monkey king?

maybe he just feels assassination being better...
maybe spend ki point to gain advantage
bonus to wisdom (for his stun dc)
can do this during the halos battle

hans' spirit helps him find his center; regain 5 ki points as an action once per day
"i did what i had to do, and so must you"
you do not know where this voice comes from, but you find it oddly calming, to see hans' face so calm after all the hardship he's gone through
what happened to him


## Dropped
### Umnos mindcontrol
Feeblemind?.. can be ended by greater restoration..
Dominate Monster at 9th level lasts up to 8 hours... she is just better at it..
Umnos in non-dominated is a previous champion of Auril, but does not need her anymore, he is as close to his own godhood as is possible.
He is CG normally. Enjoys the worship of all the Giants as Annam's presence has subsided. Wants to be the next Kavaki.

Can Irae really dominate a demi-god? Yes.
Divine boon to party if they save him +1 STR up to 20.

ALTERNATIVELY; he's crucified and about to ascend to become a death knight giant - he'll fly around in spectral form while his body is hung (they need to cast something to cancel it)

lines when freed (deep husky voice):
- "disease"
- "free"
- "not enemies" (holding back attack)
- "spell...fading...loosing hold...of my mind"
- "yeees. (backwards drawl pulling in air) i am back. thank the heavens."
- "you "
