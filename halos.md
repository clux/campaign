# Halos
## Lore
Storm giants are good spellcasters and self-sufficient, close to godhood. Umnos leads, with Serissa (quintescent) with trident.

# Entrance
Circular hangar either through open hole cylinder in floor (peek down through clouds to Protectorate). Two doors on either side lead down to bridges. Patrols Circle through here. 2 on bridge for 3 minutes as they walk halfway down as a unit while2 stands guard (will join battle by shooting lightning). 
 
If they get passed it, then they can proceed up the hallway leading to the battlemap (modified snurre 2) 

Also a circular indent in the floor above with hexagonal outlines, but can't see through. (Where dragon resides).
40ft Square grate above them leading to 13E. 1 sleeping storm giant there.
 
## DUNGEON
SCALE: 2x larger than 5ft square. 10ft squares!
Storm Giants very perceptive, they'll just instintively nom Petros.

## CENTER + TOP
### 13A Door
2 Storm Giants Guarding entrance plus 13F. They'll attack on sight, and with sufficient noise, people from 13 will wake.

NB: Doors in center are lightning activated. PERC15 to understand mechanism.

## 13D Protecttive holes
Storm giants chuck extra lightning through here.

## 13C
RIGHT: -> keys to 13F first door
Sleeping giant in 13E has the other.

## 13B? - the lever rooms
Doing lever first lets people operate the flywheels.
Each flywheel can be used to turn off the doors in the relevant section (so they don't even need electric opening, always open).

The 3 lever room, North West South i think i said.
South are the 10/11 rooms. North is the 13A north door. West is 13A west door.

13B levers control:
- top right lever: everything outside main above prismatic wall
- bottom left lever: everything outside main below prismatic wall

### 14A Resting chamber
3 storm giants meditating in a circle. Not super observant while that's going on. Chest contains clothes fit for giants and 2 supreme healing potions.
One of them is an elite elite with huge hammer: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/563935184592880430/

After gates in 13F. Blue lightning scars the walls. Large footsteps has depressed the floors in this hallway. Giant sized, but clearly heavier.

### 12B Asylum
Door: same electricity lock.
Insane cloud giant `Zavag` resides here. Very skinny, smaller than the others. Female He was trying to get a meet up. He knows a lot, but speaks like an asylum patient. Shackled to the bed, gagged.
Semi-deep, incoherent speech.
"leeet me out, ltme out"
"you cnt do thiiis tooo me"
"serissa put me here, claims i stole her octarine. i did no such thing" (he did, swallowed it)
PERS20/INT20 (after releasing him): I have it. It fuels me. He will try to fight them. Monk giant! Way of the s/Sun/Lightning Soul.
INV20: see caloused knuckles and very beefy hand even for this smaller giant, does not seem to have been caloused by the shackles
CHEST: keys to shackles.

info:
- doors open by electricity, but the queens see this
- the queens control the vault
- serissa's dress and neri's mask are the keys to the vault
- neri sees everything
- umnos under the influence of the white lady
- he wants to become the ultimate death knight

Searing Arc Strike: Burning hands dex save for 3-10d6 fire dmg
Bonus action patient defense. 18AC. 123HP

see he has taken lots of cuts, but still looks very healthy - more than you would expect

Octarine Core - grants half of overkill damage worth of temp hp - up to a maximum of 50 (for un-numbered crits)). Must replace your heart via surgomancy. Can only be done during a resurrection ritual

### 12A Serissas Chamber
Storm Giant Quintessent. Throne in center. Paranoid. Slightly mad. Will have a chat, but unwilling to let anyone pass unless they really smooch up to her vanity (like set up a church to her). Spells? Champion of `Talos` the storm Lord.

Queen Serissa: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/374572894004775015/ ish
Opulent. Oozes elecric energy. Hard to tell if she's even a corporeal being, but her dress sparkles with gold. Her staff bears a large ruby and the statue of phoenix. She's oversees the treasury, but haven't given a dime downwards anymore (she's a little insane.) Won't hear it if they talk about Irae.

soft english / ethereal voice:
"Oh, how the guards have failed."
"you know you are not allowed up here anymore?"
"well, no matter, i am not afraid to use my hands, if you know what i mean"
about irae: "she has been a tremendous help for us, do not speak ill of her"
about umnos: "umnos is accomplishing just incredible things these days"
"but i sense power in you - Talos guide me" - Cast Prismatic Wall with her dress.
death: "you fools. you dare challenge the gods. Neri will perforate your bodies so thoroughly you'd have wished you never came here"

STATS AC18 otherwise quintessent, some spells.
Crazy contingency. That also sets up a prismatic wall (can't see through it - without red wall so Champion can shoot through. Champion sees through a third eye in Serissa's forehead.

If spells fail, stat using standard quintessent attacks

Special Contigency; Stoneskin + Blur => perma res to physical dmg + disadv to hit
Fighting with Queen Neri with a special bow. Who will use Windforce. +2 awakened legendary bow. On hit can infuse electrican energy into arrow for extra 3d8 thunder damage CON SAVE 15 vs deafened (once per long rest).
Behind a prismatic wall.

Key to first part of 13F on Serissa.

if Serissa falls, Neri will be furious and unleash a lightning bolt in there.
If Serissa ports ports, she MIGHT restore HP if they rest, but she will be further in.
If they tread on immediately, she'll only have short rested and won't have her defenses.
In either case, she needs to fall before they can go to level 2.

## BATTLE NOTES
Prismatic wall is there, no red wall.
Havil is out. +14 to hit multiattack. Undecided dmg
Serissa is quite wounded. Probably will escape next round on legendary action if she takes another hit.
Havil will fight to the death though. Likely use the line attack through Faey and GW (auto crit) it it is long enough (yeah prolly, <60ft)
revealed legendary actions, but not legendary saves (allow a clutch stun, he only has +10 hit)

Active Spells: Pass Without a Trace, Prismatic Wall, Contingency(Serissa special), Whirlwind (action to move)
Arrow of Slaying on the ground (perhaps recoverable)

Recap: bought a lot of stuff, misted in a stange way and found two bosses, and did not drink lightnint resistance.

### EBA FAILURE
They throw them to Fryggt to die.

### 13-10 Havil Patrol Guard
Wielding a dragon tooth as a maul. Full Plate + Shield AC22.
Slow ass crazy dmg attacks infused with lightning. If failing too much he'll do the wave attack.

Havil has Stats similar to Fire Giant Dreadnaught. +1 plate. +3 shield 28STR (hard to wield 22STR req).
Wielding a tusk. Bludgeoning swipe attack +13 hit 4d10+8 bludgeoning. 2 attacks. Tusk is an ancient dragon tooth.


## RIGHT + VAULT
### 13F Vault Door 1/2
Locked through arcane lock (knock undoes it for 10minutes)
Giants can assemble into 13D to throw bolts if sounds are heard.
If they pound their way through, they will have an army on their hands. They can escape through 16A if so, but they will face Fryggt.
Note that passive lightning damage from the cave here as this is below the spine.

### 16A corridor
If they got through here, then they probably have the key to 16A. Found in 13C (right.)

### 16B Light room
Controls the rotation of the spire
Only affects what point the path ends out on.
9 configurations: all off => north, binary count around
000 => 0deg (north - allows passage backwards - otherwise seals light room)
001 => 45deg
010 => 90deg (east - fryggts lair)
011 => 135deg
100 => 180deg (south - overview over giants patrol below)
101 => 225deg
110 => 270deg (west)
111 => 315deg

NB: Feeding hatch for Fryggt. Large disc outside covered in blood and half chewed remains of flesh.

### 15B Reliquary
Relics inside + 50k gold in coints, goblets, necklaces. Filled with a yellow mist mist. Hear the tossing of goblets on gold.

#### Distraction Treasure Goblin Galzug
ah-haaa! runs with bag of gold - tries to escape into pentachoron.
otherwise drops his gold sack with 15k gold in it. If they see it disappear they can see understand the nature of the escape with DC20 arcana. Pentachoron is a portal to a goblin realm.

If they stop him; he'll monster voice and explain that he found a way in through sneak platform. Part of an ancient goblin tribe that silently replaces gold in vault with a fake knockoff material made from a rich citrine vein near their location. Where is this? Below Gauntlgrym. Red dragon there controls the hoard. They'll have to torture him Galzug to get him to reveal information. How far will they go?

#### Loot (outside gold)
Sunwuko's Spirit: Grant Breath of Heaven Spell: Heal all allies within 30ft 6d8 as action.
