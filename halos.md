# Entrance 

Circular hangar either through open hole cylinder in floor (peek down through clouds to Protectorate). Two doors on either side lead down to bridges. Patrols Circle through here. 2 on bridge for 3 minutes as they walk halfway down as a unit while2 stands guard (will join battle by shooting lightning). 
 
If they get passed it, then they can proceed up the hallway leading to the battlemap (modified snurre 2) 

Also a circular indent in the floor above with hexagonal outlines, but can't see through. (Where dragon resides).
40ft Square grate above them leading to 13E. 1 sleeping storm giant there.
 

# Lore 
Storm giants are good spellcasters and self-sufficient, close to godhood. Umnos leads, with Serissa (quintescent) with trident.

## Silth the Infestor (Ancient Viridian Dragon 700yo)
(Modified Shapechange Retains ability scores + senses) into Storm Giant
Looks high ranking, commander. Goes by Laufey as a Giant. Yellow eyes.
Cyan robes. Druid spells. Blue dragon breath, green dragon stats. Can poison the minds of people. Lower INT. Needs greater restoration.

Truesight, PP30. Weakened the storm giants horde from within. Irae could then easily take over even these demigods. (Paranoia + Coughing)

Will rule this place after Irae is done attempting to steer the demonlords towards major cities. Will not let them enter the vault. Which acts as her lair.
Apathetic about the beast Fryggt and levitating storm giants. She entered as a fake storm giant anyway. Knows enough druid spells to deceive.

She tried to cause a distraction near waterdeep (Gulthias tree)

Will extort them to get something of theirs so she does not call the guards.
Then will do it anyway. If they can't fight their way out, Irae will put them in the Pentachoron.

PERC: 20+ grace > normal giants
Posh + annoyed accent.

## Why is she there?
Does not need the attention of gods. Just having fun seeing humanity fail to react to risk. Will throw some chaos in for fun. Raised in Menzoberranzen under the Magnificent Matriarch, but escaped 100 years ago.
Looking forward to ruling Stormguard after Irae is done. Dragons know they can't fight DLs. So the fact that they are there now means she's not too concerned with Irae's plan.

Part of that is ensuring powerful artifacts stay outside the hands of both giants. She normally persuades them to obtain things of danger to them and hide it away. While sweet-talking Serissa.


## Umnos
Huge bulging blue muscles with a large golden cumberbud.
Blue light emits from his jaw, eyes, and it crackles from his hair (huge, windswept, crazy, even eyebrows and beard follows this). Shoes up to his knees and as large as a party member. Search for it. Very Zeusy.
Feeblemind?.. can be ended by greater restoration..
Dominate Monster at 9th level lasts up to 8 hours... she is just better at it..
Umnos in non-dominated is a previous champion of Auril, but does not need her anymore, he is as close to his own godhood as is possible.
He is CG normally. Enjoys the worship of all the Giants as Annam's presence has subsided. Wants to be the next Kavaki.

Can Irae really dominate a demi-god? Yes.
Divine boon to party if they save him +1 STR up to 20.

## Spire
Contains final crystal. Prismatic wall (30 foot sphere around it - repeat cast with the power of the spine at full power).
She can be inside the prismatic wall with it and use Dominate Monster on Umnos.
Door up to Umnos is heavily guarded and no one can actually enter.


Irae confrontation
"You know, I don't have to use my most powerful magic all the time you know"
Create undead: Summons 6 ghouls / 3 ghasts as a lair action during the battle
While in the middle of Globe of Invulnerability (conc)


# DUNGEON
SCALE: 2x larger than 5ft square. 10ft squares!

2 Storm Giants Guarding entrance plus 13F

## 13F Vault Door 1/2
ocked through arcane lock (knock undoes it for 10minutes)
Giants can assemble into 13D to throw bolts if sounds are heard.

## 12A Serissas Chamber
Storm Giant Quintessent. Throne in center. Paranoid. Slightly mad.
Not helpful in current state, but lucid. Will have a chat, but unwilling to let anyone pass unless they really smooch up to her vanity (like set up a church to her). Spells? Champion of `Talos` the storm Lord.

## 12B Asylum
Insane cloud giant `Sifthor` resides here. He was trying to get a meet up. He knows a lot, but speaks like an asylum patient. Shackled to the bed. Pleads with them to let them out

## 9 Barracks / sleeping chamber

## 14A Resting chamber
1 storm giants sleeping + 2 eating. Chest contains shit!
One of them is an elite elite with huge hammer: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/563935184592880430/
REMEMBER STORM SPELLS

After gates in 13F. Blue lightning scars the walls. Large footsteps has depressed the floors in this hallway. Giant sized, but clearly heavier.

## 16A corridor Shalzardiadile / Laufey
maybe close off 16A. 16B leads up side spire?

grins in unnatural giant.
you're new. (eyes up down, glancing at various magical items (PERC20))
PERC10 notice her footsteps are loud and thunderous, 15+ cause large depressions in the ground (similar to outside)
will not let them pass without serious persuasion. 
what does she want? them not to take anything that will harm dragons.
can be persuaded by an offering from gilgrin (hammer?)

(She will behave like her normal self because she knows no-one will believe they got in there to talk to her without use of force (in which case they won't be able to explain it away anyway).
You're aware you are breaking the rules, correct? (posher voice than usual)
These big doors are not to be opened, and Serissa would never let anyone through, so... that begs the question, why you are here.
TRANSMUTATION DETECT MAGIC ON ALL OF HER.


## 15B Reliquary
Relics inside. Filled with mist. She'll walk in there with them.
30x30 feet size. Her head will peek up.

# EBA1: 11/16 Staircase leads to Waterfountain fight from BL2 wizard tower

Hidden path up through the Behir + Basilisks.
