## Supporting; Knowledge Checks
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/g9t6dk/using_knowledge_checks_to_create_player_immersion/
Don't just have knowledge checks be, binary success/failure investigation/arcana/religion rolls:

Ask players to __give a compelling suggestion for why you might know this__. Make them link it to their backstory / story.
Just don't go over the top.

Eg: My mentor used to have a passion for herbs. When he took breaks from teaching me magic, he often spent hours lecturing me about their properties and uses, and even tried to take me some early morning walks to collect some - would he have told me about this?

If the players try, but it doesn't seem like a good source of information, __try to provide an alternative__. Reward the behaviour.
Lower DCs if you have a compelling reason in a PCs backstory!
If players narrowly miss the DC, reveal some information except one crucial detail (which they remember wrong).
Nat 20 might result in an anectote of why it it is so well-imprinted into their memory (they could create an NPC from their past - creates more canon in their backstory).

### Knowledge checks during a fight
- Asking information in the middle of a fight does not require an action, but it is harder - the DC goes up by 5 as the character's focus is split.
-  It must be done before you take any action.
-  If, during combat, you fail on your memory roll by by 5 or less, your character has the information on the tip of their tongue, but the memory hasn't surfaced quite yet . This has the following consequences:
   * Your character will remember the information when there is a moment of calm.
   * Alternatively, you can push your luck to focus and try again at the beginning of your next round. If you fail that time your character is distracted! You use your action to Dodge.
- Rolling a natural 1 on a knowledge check during a fight means the player takes the Dodge action as they lose focus.

## alcohol

### intoxication levels
1. DC11	*Tipsy*	Disadvantage on ability checks
2. DC13	*Drunk*	Speed halved due to dizziness. Disadvantage on saving throws.
3. DC15	*Hammered* Disadvantage on attack rolls. Assume a Drunk Persona for as long as you're intoxicated. Failing the save by 10 or more results in vomiting.
4. DC17	*Blacked Out* You will not remember anything from now on. In initiative, you act as if under the effects of Confusion except acting "normally" is in line with your Drunk Persona. If your DP is non-violent, then you will not make any attacks. The effect ends if you drop below this intoxication level. Failing the save by 5 or more results in vomiting.
5. DC20	*Comatose* You fall unconscious and will not wake for 3d4 hours.
6. DC25	**Dying** You fall unconscious and unless the poison is quickly removed from your bloodstream by way of Lesser Restoration, or a similar spell, straight roll death saves

### drunk personas

1. **Sloppy** Highly likely to spill your drink, or someone else's, or anything else you touch. Constant belching, with intermittent farting, which you find hilarious. Completely unaware of wardrobe malfunctions or how loud your voice is. You're stumbling all over the place and need someone else's help to really get anywhere.
2. **Waterworks*** Everything is so sad. Remember the good times? Those were great times. Now everything is bad and it's just so upsetting! So stressful! Just make sure you tell your friends that you love them and that you're sorry. Gods, you're so sorry. Do they hate you? They might hate you.
3. **Rage Incarnate** Godsdammit everything is pissing you off and you're sure as hell letting people know. You feel like you just wanna hit something, or someone, or both. Better yet, hit someone with something. See that guy? Fuck that guy!
4. **Je T'adore*** You feel really good. Other people? They feel even better. You bet if you got together with someone it'd feel great. Thank the gods so many people here look hot as the nine hells. Forget subtlety, you're trying to get lucky!
5. **The Birthday Suit** It is too hot in here. Or is it your clothes? It's probably your clothes. Get rid of them; they're too constricting anyway! Nude is way more comfortable! Besides, you got nothing to be ashamed of!
6. **Motherly*** Goodness gracious, who let all these children out without parental supervision? It's up to you to take care of these babies! Corral them and make sure they have everything they need; warm clothes, good food, and of course, your infinite wisdom!
7. **Storyteller** You've had so many interesting experiences in your life that you just have to share them with everyone here. Some things might be embellished, others might be complete fabrications, but no one knows that! All you want is to tell them stories!
8. **Kleptomaniac** There's a lot of really neat stuff here, stuff you'd really like to have, but they're probably not for sale. That's okay, if you're discreet enough maybe you can just slip it into your pocket and walk away all nonchalant. No one will notice, right?
9. **Dare Devil** You really want to impress people here. Maybe you can pull off some tricks! Like jumping from there to way over there, or doing a flip off the table, or drinking something that's on fire! That will definitely make them think you're cool!
10. **Life of the Party*** You feel like you're having the greatest night of your life! Everyone here is awesome! Crack jokes! Laugh at everything! Dance like no one is watching!

## substance abuse

### Void (Super grim Divinity 2 style substance)
Ideas from https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/jhepq7/void_and_the_grinners_a_nightmarish_cartel_for/
All of it have great ideas so leaving it here. They also build a 1-3rd level adventure idea based on a cult of masochists who slowly turn into beholder like features (maybe umberhulk origin story idea).

> Void is a dark and viscous substance, appearing as either deep blue, purple, or black depending on the lighting and the batch. If one looks closely at a vial of void, they might notice that it seems to move and swirl about of its own accord. Void is extremely addictive and is injected subcutaneously using a large metal syringe. Its viscosity often causes it to bubble out from the injection site, damaging surrounding tissues and creating large lesions on a user’s arms. Due to the lack of disposable syringes, injection instruments are typically shared among several addicts. This leads to the spread of various diseases, most notably cackle fever, sewer plague, and sight rot.

> Beyond the uncanny resilience void grants, it is known for several other properties. Its primary feature is the euphoric highs users get. Users enter a dreamlike state, drawing upon heightened senses to help them experience the world as much more pleasing than it really is. A more disturbing property of void is the pleasure one derives from experiencing pain while high. Void addicts are effectively turned into masochists and have no fear of pain or damage to their bodies (they are often seen self-mutilating for pleasure). Void is also known to augment the brain’s receptiveness to psychic energies, and this is thought to be the source of the hive-like tactics and mentality of the Grinners.

> Void begins to permanently alter the body after the first few months of addiction. These changes first manifest in the paling of the skin, which becomes clammy. Addicts also experience total hair loss and extreme loss of weight within the first few months. After some time, void begins to warp and disfigure the body. An addict’s teeth will naturally sharpen, their skull shape might warp, their eyes may change sizes or colors separate of each other, and they might begin to become lopsided in their musculature. Reptilian-like eyes and bony protrusions are also common. Less common is the development of translucent skin, which reveals the addict’s muscles, tissues, organs, and blood vessels underneath. Void also damages the brain in a process known as brain rot.

> Void hardens and expands into sharp protrusions when left at a cool temperature. Thus, it is always kept slightly warm. Void addicts who die in the cold are known to become immensely heavy and grow large crystalline spikes from their corpses.

> Void is incredibly dangerous to manufacture as it is distilled from beholder pus. Once a beholder is captured, it is injected with a cocktail of stimulants and sedatives that prevents it from sleeping or moving. The beholder’s tongue is bolted to its bottom jaw, and its main eye is either removed or blinded. The eyes on each of its stalks are then impaled with a needle attatched to a large tube. These wounds are allowed to fester, generating large amounts of pus, blood, and fluid which are then pumped through the tubes into large distillery vats for processing. The pus is separated from other liquids and purified to become void.


**Delivery**: Subcutaneous injection of 1ml of void is an effective dose.
**Addiction DC**: Extremely addictive. The creature must succeed a DC 18 constitution saving throw each use or become addicted.
**Initial Effects**: A high creature experiences void-induced masochism, dreamlike euphoria, immunity to fear, and advantage on perception checks.
**Secondary Effects**: A high creature experiences disadvantage on intelligence checks, advantage on rolls to resist dying from disease (but not when stopping its progression), vulnerability to psychic damage and disadvantage against charm effects.
**Side-Effects**: After 1d4 months of use, the following occurs in slow progression: hair loss, pale and clammy skin, sharp teeth, warping body and eyes, translucent skin. Brain Rot: for every 1d4 months a creature spends addicted to void, it must make a DC 15 constitution saving throw or permanently lose 1 point of intelligence as its brain is slowly liquified .
**Overdose**: If a creature takes more than one dose of void less than 4 hours apart, it must make a DC 15 constitution saving throw or fall unconscious. If the creature fails the save by 5 or less, it is blinded permanently. If it fails the save by over 8, it dies.
**Withdrawals and Satiation**: If an addict does not take void at least once every 14 hours, they begin cravings and hallucinations. The addict gains one level of exhaustion for every 24 hours it away from void. Instead of dying on level 6, a creature must roll 1d12 + 5. This determines the number of days the creature spends on exhaustion level 5. After the last day, the creature rolls a DC 12 constitution check. On a success, it recovers from its addiction (although it retains any modifications). On a failure, it becomes comatose or dies (DM’s choice). There are possible ways to negate these effects, including magical therapy and alchemical solutions.
**Street Price**: Void costs anywhere from 5sp to 5gp, depending on the buyer. Poorer people have their void ‘subsidized’ by the Grinners.


## Active vs. Passive Dungeon
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/fusz92/the_active_dungeon_vs_the_passive_dungeon/
Both styles require contrivances. Active => more tactics. Passive => more exploration, puzzles, slow smarts.
TL;DR: neither style incorrect, just be aware of the tradoffs.
### Passive Dungeon
Majority of dungeons. Locations to be explored, and have enemies. Avoid obstacles, disarm traps. Passive means the dungeon is peaceful and devoid of combat; exists in state largely agnostic to the party's presence. E.g. raiding necro's long dead crypt.
Traps may exist, or might have been sprung already. Dungeon has no ways to respond aside from existing enemies.

#### Pros:
- Can help create a sense of ‘deep history’ through forgotten ruins and ancient structures
- Extremely flexible in terms of accommodating a variety of challenges
- Can exist agnostic of faction politics
- Familiar (and by extension comfortable) to many players
#### Cons:
- Often require contrivances to justify puzzles
- Seldom change the political landscape of a campaign once cleared (compared to something like clearing a town of an occupying army)
- Goals can become repetitive (i.e. an endless string of ‘go here, retrieve this treasure’)

### Active
Actively responding to players. E.g. raiding necro castle in n-day military raid ops. Necromancer actively trying to oppose the party by throwing enemies at them and creating obstacles to impede or prevent progress.
Doors rigged on the fly, water sources poisoned, staircases destroyed after before them, monsters actively wait for party to rest.
Arms race to secure rest locations. Tactical game, moves, countermoves.

#### Pros:
- Provide out-of-combat strategic opportunities a layer above in-combat tactics
- The gameplay loop of moves and countermoves is generally satisfying
- Can have a strong sense of progression as earlier parts of the dungeon are made safer
- Generate satisfying conclusions as the party wins a war of attrition

#### Cons:
- Can become a slog
- Leave little room for things like puzzles and riddles, which many players enjoy
- Combat-heavy and may have little variety as a result
- Require contrivances of intelligent enemies being holed-up in a location in order to function

## Holistic Dungeon
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/fbbj2f/building_better_dungeons_using_puzzle_game_design/

### Tier 1 Dungeon
My-first-dungeon. A bunch of thematically-disconnected rooms where puzzles exist in a vacuum and enemies are all but randomised. In one room you fight skeletons, in the next you fight drow, in the next you fight a yeti. There is no overarching theme tying the dungeon together, and possibly no deeper a goal than ‘get to the last room to grab the loot there’. This is where many DMs start out. There’s nothing wrong with it, but it’s important to recognise it as the entry-level stepping stone that it is.

### Tier 2 Dungeon
Tier 2 – The nine-to-five dungeon. This baby is a real workhorse in Dungeons & Dragons. There is a thematic tie that informs the puzzles and enemy encounters. Perhaps you are clearing kobolds out of an old forgeworks so that it can resume operation. The fights are against kobolds, the traps and puzzles are mechanisms built by the kobolds to keep intruders out, and maybe the final fight is a group of fanatical kobolds protecting a dragon egg and trying to warm it in the heart of the forge. This is the tier that 90% of all dungeons fall into, including those in published adventures. I want to be clear, this is not bad design. In fact it’s really good design. It’s immersive, satisfying and ultimately creates a positive gameplay experience.

### Tier 3 Dungeon
Tier 3 – The Holistic Dungeon. The dungeon is fundamentally defined by a theme or mechanic, and every facet of the dungeon ties back to this theme or mechanic. Everything from the way encounters must be approached to the integration of puzzles and how they must be solved. The Tucker’s Kobolds dungeon is a classic example of the Holistic Dungeon, wherein an entire philosophical approach to building and running encounters defines everything that takes place in the dungeon. It is also not the only form of implementation of the Holistic Dungeon, and my aim here is to discuss one of the other major ways to approach building the Holistic Dungeon.

### Holistic Goals
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/fbbj2f/building_better_dungeons_using_puzzle_game_design/
#### Have One Underlying Mechanic
E.g. the portal gun. The time travel mechanic of DOTT. Doom's flashlight.
Tie everything to the mechanic.
Puzzles do not exist in a vacuum.
Puzzles can change the world around them (rotational puzzles, lantern illumination, lever far below everything).
Try to Increase Complexity By Expanding On Your Mechanic, Not By Adding New Mechanics:
- Find new ways to use the same mechanic
- Combine different challenges so they occur simultaneously.
- If all else fails, add more rules to your core mechanic (can frustrate players!)
Introduce elements that complement your mechanic!
Build a mechanic suitable to the scope of your dungeon.

## Megadungeon
How to run a 100-room dungeon. Settlements, entrance points, expectations.
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/i4s06k/building_better_campaigns_using_puzzle_game/

### Gates
Gate entrance between reginos:
- political actions needed with factions to allow progression (political obstacles)
- party needs to reform
- fractured landscapes from natural disasters, liquefied earth (physical obstacles)
- guards disallow entry (combat / political obstacles)
- a __Fly__ scroll can be used for _semi gated_ progression
- item unlocks that allows certain destruction (obstacles / guards) or manipulation (ancient keys)
- financial obstacles

### Linearity
Allow non-linearity (if you want). Can be done by having many gates. One _might_ might help with another.
Consider what are HUB worlds and what are SUB worlds.

### Megadungeon Puzzle
Something that spans a megadungeon. A passive underlying puzzle.
Spread semi-related (seemingly unrelated) breadcrumbs throughout. Holy texts, abandoned. Old glyphs.

## Technological Revolution
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/iklr5y/maintaining_technological_realism_the_industrial/
How is big tech funded? How does industrialism develop?

> In the Industrial Revolution that actually happened, a number of reasonably centralised states were able to invest in technological advancements in such a way that saw the rapid spread of things like train networks, electrical grids, telephone lines, and more. These are the sorts of things Governments usually invest in, as the cost of building such networks is prohibitively high for private entities who need to turn profits within reasonable lengths of time. It’s exactly why Governments today tend to be the entities that do things like build roading infrastructure, or maintain waterworks and sewerage.
> economically strong states with the ability to build these things are usually the ones that end up building them.

> But what if a non-centralised state in the midst of an economic crisis suddenly discovered electricity? Would it become widespread as rapidly as it did in the real world?

### Industrial Pocket
>  a single eccentric Elf has put many long years of work in to building an electrical grid in the city he happens to live in. As the city emerges as a political power in the turmoil of the larger state’s collapse they begin protecting the secrets of this technology. As a result, electricity does not become widespread. It remains localised to this one powerful and influential city.

Magitech:
> There is that other common way of introducing pseudo-industrial technologies in our fantasy settings, and that is to have them be born of magic rather than industry. In settings that lean heavily on these, golems and other constructs are used as a kind of mechanised workforce that allows for things like factories to exist. We’re able to have things akin to wireless telephone networks by having fantasy phonebooths where regular people can use the Sending spell at-will. If you’re not fussed about the basis for your Industrial pastiche being technological then the ‘Magitech’ approach is a good way to go.

vs. the masses:
> If we’re too reliant on magic then those who can do magic become too powerful compared to those who can’t, and scientific technology is a way of evening out the playing field. It acts as a kind of ‘check and balance’ on societies that use lots of Magitech.

Maybe the people rally behind them as a source of security, and the ruling nobles know better than to oppose the will of an armed populace.

### Past Civilisation's Tech
Were they more advanced than you are? They have artifacts, Damascus Steel, Greef Fire.
Were they less advanced than you are? Just now able to unearth it, due to your own tech, or digging efforts through servants, modern explosives that ancient wards never accounted for.

Cool examples:
- Terrible machines that absorb magic and fire it back in bolts of electrical plasma have allowed them to eradicate the blasphemous spellcasters of the city once and for all.

## Thieves guilds
Things to consider with compelling thieves guilds.
1. **Membership** - Identify a need that is not being met. Your group needs something, but it is withheld. Substances / Gold / Political Sway. Once goals are attained, the new goals grow and morph. Member base might change.
2. **Organisation** - How does a person become a leader among these aggrieved members? What qualifications did they have, how did it shape the group? Is he radical?
3. **Goals** - What problems does a group have, what do leaders to do address these grievances? Solution might be stepping stone, or all that the leadership understands. Can anyone contribute, no matter how shady?
4. **Secrecy** - What purpose does secrecy serve the organisation. Afraid of found? Why? What powers are likely to find them, and what will happen then? Don't be nebulous here. Smugglers afraid of one guard captain? Cultists afraid of one religious leader cracking down? Maybe secrecy isn't simple; shadow cabinet. Parallel organisations. They could operate in the open, but choose not to.
5. **Tensions** - Conflict, resolution, storytelling arise from how each step of the way the group gets further away from the reasons that first created the group. A secret society benefits from the idiosyncratic choices tha tlead to where it is because each offers new avenues for tensions that your party can explore. Maybe the party can unravel the web, and dethrone leaders, or change the organisation.

Examples from Chinese/Russian history:
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/itjn7p/stranger_than_fiction_ii_thieves_guilds_and_the/

### Triads
Based in local identities within China. Groups of people originating in the same area, but living in a new one. Diaspora.
Poorest people usually. A helping system for people to stay afloat in a new location.
Might work for leaders of both sides of official rule, and offer dirty contracts on behalf of Chinese rulers.
State sponsored organised crime.
Secrecy forced on the organisation.
Unregulated, because all underhand deals.
The people are loyal to the people in the group, not where they live, so are open to a lot.
Tension; serve your people in strange lands, but you are taken over by the rich and powerful who have no reason to support you.
### The Literary Society (1911 Revolution)
Few human rights, emperialism feeding on China.
New group pushing for a revolution and a democratic government.
In the past revolutionary propagandists and organisation tried to recruit military into their plots by pitching directly to recruits. Soldiers generaly could not join revolutionary organisations in a safe way, so they made their own.
Small groups like Literary Society got together tot alk about the revolution and how to recruit new members from within their units.
Goal was to overthrow the Qing dynasty through military conversion, but military has always sided with the throne.
By having multiple tiny barely connected groups it made it untraceable (even to other revolutionary).
Every organisation had the same plan, and it just kind of worked at the end when one group started making bombs, and one detonated.
Secrecy made this possible, but also made they had no idea of what they were doing and who to trust.
Their leader; guy that was going to be executed for being in a revolutionary group, and they just begged him to become their leader.
Secrecy meant they had no friends, didn’t know who to contact, didn’t know who to trust, so they ended up trusting a guy who did not want to be there.
By the time real revolutionary leaders who had been trying to start this revolution for decades showed up, the revolution was full of bandwagoners.
Once it was time to move beyond the small, secret group phase, their organization and beliefs worked against them. They believed, pretty earnestly, that all these people jumping on the bandwagon must be revolutionaries coming from their own secret groups, or at least have been converted to the idea of overthrowing the Emperor. As they found, some of their allies were generally behind overthrowing the throne, but only so they could take it themselves.
### The Communist International
