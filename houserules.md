## item homebrew liberally
fun complexity in pathfinder, choosing items (armor not just one stat)
### armor
- mastercraft (+1) / dwarvencrafted (+1 with res bludge) / elvencrafted (+1 with pierce res)
- maybe intimidation / charisma bonuses
### weapons
- steal from dota / diablo 3
- change dice around; allow some D12 or D20 dmg dice
- brutal crit builtin
- crit on 19 and 20 (crazy for rogue)

## misc
- [30 point point buy (max 16 min 7)](https://www.dndbeyond.com/linkout?remoteUrl=http%253a%252f%252fchicken-dinner.com%252f5e%252f5e-point-buy.html%2523customrace%2526NA%25268%25268%25268%25268%25268%25268%25260%25260%252630%252616%25266%252619%252615%252612%25269%25267%25265%25264%25263%25262%25261%25260%25261%25262%25264%25266%25269%25264%25264%25264%25264%25264%25264)
- milestone XP
- no encumberance (within reason)
- mixing potions has special effects
- gradual success/failures for rolls
- more difficult identification (need to identify to attune)
- spellcasters can identify spells being cast on the fly (if familiar, arcana check)
- standing up from prone provokes attacks of opportunity

## inspiration
only for
- clever use of trait/quirks
- roleplaying a weakness
- using rights and wrongs
- exceptional RP
- staying IC for the session
