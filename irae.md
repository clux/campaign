# Irae T'sarran
Drow high priestess of Kiaransalee (turned champion). Lived in Maerimydra but took over the city, exterminated everyone, and moved it into a pocket dimension where she built her fortress.

Became a lich whilst studing forbidden necromancy in the Acropolis of Vanathos. 

## OMEGA PLANS
### STAGE 1: ARROGANCE
They think they're just going to get the last piece of the relic. Sends demon lords at Waterdeep in an epic battle.
Demogorgon on her side.
Party + Felgolos + Diana and mages guild on other side.
Something major needs to be sacrificed here. Demon lords needs to fade after this.

### STAGE 2: TRANSFORMATION
She gets the last relic and start absorbing the powers of Kiaransalee, perhaps even transform into her. She will rip through cities using this.

### STAGE 3: DESPERATION
Players use their final abilities to somehow take her down in a multi-stage fight. (Minor format of arrogance, transformation, blowback). Dark Souls fight. They get some of her items?

### STAGE 4: BLOWBACK
Chase her back into her phylactery based on previous knowledge.
USE PLAYER PLANNING TO STEAL GOOD IDEAS.

### Fighting her in her lair
She is like Friede. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvZTBG7UMqU
Which means she protects the creator in real life. Maybe she is an avatar of The Banshee?

Dex Save to evade her scythe attack. Disadv. when she's attacking out of invisibility, unless they use audio cues well (PERC20).
360 AOE range on scythe, huge damage.
If she hits you, she will always get in a combo. Either by lifting you with a scythe, or showving an ice blast to your face, stunning you.

Stage 2.
Dying => Father/Statue joins the fight, throwing fire all around the place in a giant vase (huge AOE fire damage) and half destroying the place (all obstacles around), and they will fight together with fire and ice.
Note that father/statue has super high perception and will opportunity attack legendary action.

Stage 3.
If they both die, all energy is left used to resurrect her one final time; blackflame friede. Higher damage / range scythe, she can now fly charge attack.
Necrotic waves (higher AOE range) instead of cold now.

If phylactery is dead, then with every hit, she releases souls that creep out and damage with necromantic red energy.

## History of Kiaransalee
Took over the east, and rendered it corrupted. 700 years ago.
She faced a set of powerful enemies:
- Shario Dyounoru a champion of Mystra
- Akkhan worked under Umnos and was was the chosen of Kavaki
- Sunwuko was the champion of Selune
- Natalya was the champion of the Raven Queen

Laeral will know about her, but all the powers she used to banish her caused the great sundering. Magic ceased to function. Shario perished


All books about it were erased.


Waterdeep mages made a pact with the gods to get rid of her, but could not 


## Super Past
500 years old.

Has a painting that takes you to her lair (which does contain her phylactery now).

## Past
Freed Silth from Magnificent Matriarch and infiltrated it within the storm giants lair.
Had storm giants cause trouble below, cut off trading routes.
Extracted mind-control powers from a necroified aboleth; Koth
Extracted lightning powers from a necroified storm giant; Umnos
Had Giants coordinatedly open portal to the abyss to let demon lords through.
Uses the magic divices there to steer one demon lord at a time, so she can infiltrate and grab the most powerful artifacts.

She gives some to her servants as they help steer the demon lords.
She stole the diamond from Luskan after the raid.

## Servants

Has the powers of Whelm + the amulet of Mordai
Silth. Has a lair in the underdark
(Took out 2 players; Zed + Iz)

### Silth the Infestor - Ancient Viridian Dragon
Has the power of a green and blue dragon. Can poison the minds of people and lower their intelligence. Truesight. PP30. Symptoms; paranoia + coughing.

### Celerum - Mage

### Umnos / Fracto Nimbuli - Storm Giant Elite
Can cast storm spear: https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/f7a6xj/storm_spear_two_variants_strike_your_enemies_down/ . Same as Lightning strike, but a withering bone spear attack instead that has CON save vs Necrotic DMG.

Umnos is a Storm Giant with champion capabilities. Legendary resists.
18 AC. More HP. CON: 24 (+12 save). Immunity to charm/stun (partial)/polymorph.
Resists Cold + Lightning.
Wields Bracers of Defense + Greatsword on his back (+16 to hit 10ft reach).
The greatsword is a +3 iridium greatsword that can be used to 

Can also cast Storm of Vengeance.

## Motivation
Revenge on all mages guild across the world for the punishment of the dark elves. Racial banishment because of one bad drow?

Also bad blood for the entrapment of Kiaransalee to Lolth (hence destruction there - most of her followers not in Menzo anyway).

NB: "Revenge is about something that has already happened, and when you are trying to achieve vengeance, you are investing your everything into a venture that will lead you to no benefit at the end."

## Drow History -> Dark Seldarine
Ilythiri (old elven race that became the drow)
dhaerow (traited) -> corrupted into drow
Araushnee -> Lolth (the mother)
Corellon (The Protector/Father of the Seldarine)
They had twins: Vhaeraun (Masked Lord/Mage / Lord of Shadow) + Eilistraee (Masked Lady / Dark Dancer)

Kiaransalee was part of the Dark Seldarine. She ascended to become a demigod.
Belly of Blood (Orcus clashed with Kiaransalee - she killed him!).

Cleric of Ghaunadaur might be a drow thing now after Ghaunadaur took Juiblex's powers. Rogues of Vhaeraun (Braegan), or surface dwellers under Eilistraee.

## Goals
Wants to grab the diamond in the tower arcane after getting Yeenoghu to destroy the defenses and cause a weakening in its defenses. Then can become powerful enough to cast high level spells.

Will then want to raid Waterdeep of its most powerful artifacts. By sending Baphomet down.

But needs to keep Halos under her control to steer the Demon Lords, they are fickle.

## Protections
Casts mindblank every morning (immune to mind control type + divination spells) 

Has a 10 day contingency to do X (5th level spell that uses one action) if BAD CONDITION 

Passive flight + truesight. 
Chronomancy. She imprisoned Andariel (Neko Hime).
