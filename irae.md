# Irae T'sarran
Drow high priestess of Kiaransalee (turned champion). Lived in Maerimydra but took over the city, exterminated everyone, and moved it into a pocket dimension where she built her fortress.

Became a lich whilst studing forbidden necromancy in the Acropolis of Vanathos. 


## History of Kiaransalee
Took over the east, and rendered it corrupted. 700 years ago.
She faced a set of powerful enemies:
- Shario Dyounoru a champion of Mystra
- Akkhan worked under Umnos and was was the chosen of Kavaki
- Sunwuko was the champion of Selune

Laeral will know about her, but all the powers she used to banish her caused the great sundering. Magic ceased to function. Shario perished


All books about it were erased.


Waterdeep mages made a pact with the gods to get rid of her, but could not 


## Super Past
500 years old.


## Past
Freed Silth from Magnificent Matriarch and infiltrated it within the storm giants lair.
Had storm giants cause trouble below, cut off trading routes.
Extracted mind-control powers from a necroified aboleth; Koth
Extracted lightning powers from a necroified storm giant; Umnos
Had Giants coordinatedly open portal to the abyss to let demon lords through.
Uses the magic divices there to steer one demon lord at a time, so she can infiltrate and grab the most powerful artifacts.

She gives some to her servants as they help steer the demon lords.

## Fighting her in her lair
She is like Friede. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvZTBG7UMqU
Which means she protects the creator in real life. Maybe she is an avatar of The Banshee?

Dex Save to evade her scythe attack. Disadv. when she's attacking out of invisibility, unless they use audio cues well (PERC20).
360 AOE range on scythe, huge damage.
If she hits you, she will always get in a combo. Either by lifting you with a scythe, or showving an ice blast to your face, stunning you.

Stage 2.
Dying => Father/Statue joins the fight, throwing fire all around the place in a giant vase (huge AOE fire damage) and half destroying the place (all obstacles around), and they will fight together with fire and ice.
Note that father/statue has super high perception and will opportunity attack legendary action.

Stage 3.
If they both die, all energy is left used to resurrect her one final time; blackflame friede. Higher damage / range scythe, she can now fly charge attack.
Necrotic waves (higher AOE range) instead of cold now.

If phylactery is dead, then with every hit, she releases souls that creep out and damage with necromantic red energy.

## Motivation
Wants to grab the diamond in the tower arcane after getting Yeenoghu to destroy the defenses and cause a weakening in its defenses. Then can become powerful enough to cast high level spells.

Will then want to raid Waterdeep of its most powerful artifacts. By sending Baphomet down.

But needs to keep Halos under her control to steer the Demon Lords, they are fickle.
