# Kavaki - The Ram Lord
Domains: Protection, Strength, Travel, War.

## Boreal Temple
Pilgrimage place for Goliaths.

Valkyrie Herfjatur tells them about Kavaki's philosophy:
- pursue competition
- fair play
- survival of the fittest


"The philosophy of Kavaki is pretty simple. We strive to live an authentic life. A life in tune with our values, so that we can act on our instincts and know that we did all we could.

The first part of that is being able to know the difference between right or wrong. Good or Evil, if you will."

## Lore
Book found in Gilgrin. Talks about various creator gods at the early times when the elves were considered gods. Unlike what's been told that Goliath's being some sort of mutant human, or giant cross bread, the Goliath race was created by Kavaki:

Ram-Lords clerics tell that he found atop the highest mountain peak, a bush that grew gems instead of fruit. He plucked the gems and from them came the first goliaths, whom he instructed to find hidden bounty amidst the mountains, and to protect the tribe from harm.

It also tells of the story of Gruumsh (god of the orcs) who in ancient time battled with the elven god of Corellon Larethian, and lost an eye to a magical spear cast by Corellon. This book instead claims he was blinded Condemn, a spell of radiant energy only known to Kavaki and his champion. After being blinded, Gruumsh willingly gouged his eye out.

## Moonstones
### Tears of Father
Entry level. Start seeing signs of Kavaki's powers. Learns how to fully utilize it in the temple.

### Gilgrin Moonstone
Dear to Akkhan, but not the most powerful one.

When in the presence of a cleric/paladin of Kavaki, detect/good and evil sense is passive and focused.

Divine Sense: True Sight of Kavaki: 100ft range, not blocked by cover.

The presence of strong evil registers on your eyes like flashing crimson, and powerful good shows to you like a bright viridian illumination. Conflicting forces of alignment show up, but are harder to interpret. Your sense of awareness to such forces is passive, and you know the location of any creature within 60 feet of you that is not behind total cover. You know the type (celestial, fiend, or undead) of any being whose presence you sense, but not its identity (the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich, for instance). Within the same radius, you can use a religion check 3 times per day to try to interpret the alignment of conflicting forces.

Stone's Endurance is twice as effective.

### Akkhan's Grave
His spirit resides within the big one in his heart.
This one can be used to complete "Divine Scourge"
Alternatively, it can be used passively to cast Holy Weapon once per day.

## Herald
The herald of Kavaki is a titan with 20 Hit Dice that looks like a ram-headed goliath. His allies are hound archons, leonal guardinals, and hound archon heroes.
