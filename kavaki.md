Valkyrie Herfjatur tells them about Kavaki's philosophy:
- pursue competition
- fair play
- survival of the fittest


"The philosophy of Kavaki is pretty simple. We strive to live an authentic life. A life in tune with our values, so that we can act on our instincts and know that we did all we could.

The first part of that is being able to know the difference between right or wrong. Good or Evil, if you will."
