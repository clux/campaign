## Post Yeenoghu
Corruption spreads. People transform. Old watchers (ghostly guard) roam the city to clear out the corruption, but they treat everything as hostile.

### Watchers
Watchers of the Abyss rise to clear out corruption.
They fight against humans taken over so have a very heavy counter-humanoid style:
- shield guards rush into your face
- 2 more attack from the back
- 2 more shoot fire from the sides

along with Millwood Knights. Huge ogre like beasts in full armor and huge axes.
bowmen fortified in the distance

## Tower Arcane
Castle erected by Nelithanar. Was a spellward and huge stone walls that look like a tree now. Huge. Home to the academy for the Arcane Brothehood.

Mages have color suffixes. Kazhen the Red.

### Lore
Has books on Demon Lords from Mordenkainen himself.
Learn about the rivalries and chaotic nature (yeenaghu and baphomet), i.e. that they are unlikely to orchestrate grand plans themselves.

### Arklem
Actually, a 750 year old wizard turned lich, that just keeps Modify Memory / Glibness at super high level at people to make them feel like he's not that old / telling the truth.

Been harnessing the power of the Eternal Star (Irae), and growing increasingly careless over the years as his power has been unchecked.

Holds the top area at the tower. Given control over Yeenoghu for Eternal Star.
Husband of the former Valindra Shadowmantle. Went to Thay with several items, to reunite with Valindra. He has a deal with Irae. He'll get Neverwinter? They share phylactery?

### Celerum
Tall, thin 1.9m blond hair blue eyes. Fine black robes, jewel-inlaid golden belt. Ambitious, and calculating, but ultimately intelligent and knew that his position would not let him do anything to further his goals without finesse.

Detected unusually strong conjuration energy at Stormguard Citadel. Sent them there to investigate.

Spell researches, helped out with Chronomancy. Ported out to Neverwinter during the attack. Doesn't want to go to Waterdeep. Knows Arklem is a lich, and he wanted to become one as well. But now the star is gone, so he will try to sucker up to powers in NWN.

Saw Yeenoghu smash his way through the cities defenses and smash a huge hole in the center of the tower arcane.
