# Boreal Valley
Icewind regiment of the frost giants.

How to get there?
- Sansuri message
- Travel to GW's temple

## Frost Giant Castle
Ruled by Jarl Storvald.
Sansuri back and guarantees safe passage. Can use the maps from PartyOfTwo Dungeons 1 to illustrate.

Some goliath's subservient to them, and help foraging and retrieving protection money from IWD.
Goliaths know the legends.

## Status
Increasing military spending. Upgrading blades. Words from Waterdeep to prepare for anything.
Ultimately no help from coast right now, they are too defensive.
Coast also wants diamonds, but trade lines are cut off.

## Goliath Mine
A dried up local source of diamonds. Used to be a tourist attraction for goliaths from Luskan in better times.
Now it's sealed off.

Death Knight Akkhan has killed all past miners only undead left now.
Some ghosts still present it as a tourist attraction. Broken sentences.

Eyes burning blue within the helmet of the dwarf. Steed? He should have a horse.

Weapon; Maul +3. Condemn.
