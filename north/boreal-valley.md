# Boreal Valley
Icewind regiment of the frost giants. Lower area of the Boreal Valley.
Called such because it's the line splitting the truly boreal regions (where parts of Alturiak is permanently dark).

How to get there?
- Sansuri message (chosen)
- Travel to GW's temple

## Looks
Sun just barely above the horizon for 1h a day.

## Sansuri
Sansuri back and guarantees safe passage. Can use the maps from PartyOfTwo Dungeons 1 to illustrate. She serves as the main political advisor, as well as being the Countess of the Boreal Valley.
"hey we are in the boreal valley, what do you know of the diamond mines, do you have any contacts; goliath temple.

## Frost Giant Castle
Ruled by Jarl Storvald. INT10. Super strong.
Invites them to food and mead

Once eating, goliaths serve them, then casually mention:
- Jarl: Sure is plenty of meat this time of year.
- Sansuri: Yes, dear, but do remember what this means
- Jarl: Ja. Vi have poerful enemies ahead. But that is NO REASON for us to reject such what nature has given us at the heart of the dark season, no less.

Tell them they are welcome to food and celebrations. Tarsakh is upon them. Birth of the new year. Marked in six days by the longest night. Mention meaning of the name Boreal Valley.

### Policies
Some goliath's subservient to them, and help foraging and retrieving protection money from IWD. Also have a few Frost Giants out there as muscle.

## Status
Increasing military spending. Upgrading blades. Words from Waterdeep to prepare for anything (drag gnoll corpse).
Ultimately no help from coast right now, they are too defensive.
Coast also wants diamonds, but trade lines are cut off.

### Gnoll Hook
They don't know how long until, or if Yeenoghu attacks. But they can locate it with tremor sensing instruments left behind (netherese tech). Use the lair template from Luskan.

### Rumors
Goliaths know about Kavaki, and the Old Witch. Most of the healthy and powerful, but subjugated, and happy where they are. Even though many of the frost giants are a bit brash (calling them by their nicknames, Stonecarver, Flintwalker, Foodleaper, Bravechaser).

An older Goliath `Kanapath Kulumathala`. (Other goliath will suggest calling her `Truthweaver` instead)

- on Akkhan: The Slain Saint. The strongest of them all. Dead, buried, forgotten.
- on Akkhan's Burial / Diamond Mine: "At the last noon of Alturiak, Farron Peak shows the way." (oddly sheer peak atop a smaller mountain on the west side of the range, rises almost like a rectangle for about 50m~ below a final snow topped crest).
- on healthcare / or Faron Peak: Old Witch cures all (cannot say for a price, twitches)
- on Giants

People know of a witch doctor living up there; the Old Witch (baba yaga).
=> they can go ask her for secrets (at horrific costs), or wait for noon in the valley and watch the shadow strike where the door is buried.


### Baba Yaga's Hut
#### Scary Zone
Halucinatory terrain. They'll see things. Trees drop a mist of snowy particles on you. Head spinning. Message from Sansuri halfway throughout. "Is everything OK?, I've lost you on the scry"
    "oh, no, she knows you, this is... THIS IS WHERE YOU DIE."
Jumpscare between the trees. Trees stomp around like legs.
Mordai's parents casting them out. Seeing her mother throw you out.

#### Inside
Only one can enter at a time. If battle, her entire hut will retreat into the scary zone, leaving the player with a curse.

She's a hag who can teleport with her enormous mortar and pestle.
Huge wave of black thick hair, two  enormous thiefling horns, and purple skin. Braid of brown decaying fangs worn draped from her horns like a beard. She turns towards you with her enormous nouse and two small dull grey eyes with only tiny dots as pupils.
Trades secrets for Akkhan's crossbow, or a passage to the feywild. "Wish to see my bethrothed Eladrin (Ara Genris, a noble overseeing the operations of the Watchers, always been the first to shy away from altercations with the Fomorians.), or some way to sell out Felgolos, perhaps add 10 years to one player - who then loses one DEX (not fixed by greater restoration).
Will reveal to the cleverer party members that she simply values the essence of life. "Looks, health, and power is important, but pain, suffering and injustice is the fuel of life that makes one fight. I give people a little bit of both."

## Goliath Mine
A dried up local source of diamonds. Converted to be a tourist attraction for goliaths from Luskan in better times, Akkhan buried there around the same time, who was a great inspiration to everyone in the region. Made diamond rings and rods for magic practicioners.

Necromancers tried to raise Akkhan in a cultist ritual to bring back the good times, but it went disastrously wrong. Now the undead patron saint of Kavaki roams the halls, drained the life of everyone still inside, and demands utmost servitude. He demanded the goliaths guard the entrance until they died of hunger, the dwarves kept mining till their death, and the netherese elves keep making diamond trinkets (which fill his chamber) - however, due to spells have been kept alive. Fortified themselves up north west.

Now it's sealed off. Created a rock fall over the castle doors, then it froze over. Auril has maintained an unending winter over the area anyway. On winter solstice, the low light of the sun across a

### Dungeon
![](boreal-mine.jpg)

Passive dungeon. Traps. Puzzles. Netherese Tech.
Mechanic; must unseal the evil befallen the tomb. Must release the elves from their creation, dwarves from their mining, goliaths from their guarding (either by killing all of them, or by destroying ???). The elves/dwarves/goliaths therein are weak, hungry, but will use the environment to defend themselves. Escaping and unleashing traps from the ceiling. Rolling boulders.

Walking into the water activates a BORE WORM. Guides them into the back entrance. Trapped.

Tombs all empty early on. They were graves to fallen miners. Tombs later on are for revenants.
Elven factory has diamond cutters. They are pretty intricate pieces of technology from the netherese empire (lasers, that must remain plugged in). Top left room has 5 lasers.

Maybe something like a phaerim: https://dmdave.com/phaerimm/
heals on spell damage. Maybe make it more construct like. Green obleisk like pillars (what looks like tomb stones). Unleashes lightning to nearby enemies when the dungeon is activated (happens when the elves do it).

Aeonic Drifters? CC177

## Akkhan
> Eyes burning blue within the helmet of the dwarf.

Death Knight with modified Hellfire Orb (radiant/necrotic damage instead).
Immune to all damage. Due to crystals in the room. Can be stunned or held though.
Maybe he can speak like Aetera in Divinity2.
