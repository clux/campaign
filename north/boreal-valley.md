# Boreal Valley
Icewind regiment of the frost giants. Lower area of the Boreal Valley.
Called such because it's the line splitting the truly boreal regions (where parts of Alturiak is permanently dark).

How to get there?
- Sansuri message (chosen)
- Travel to GW's temple

## Looks
Sun just barely above the horizon for 1h a day.

## Sansuri
Sansuri back and guarantees safe passage. Can use the maps from PartyOfTwo Dungeons 1 to illustrate. She serves as the main political advisor, as well as being the Countess of the Boreal Valley.
"hey we are in the boreal valley, what do you know of the diamond mines, do you have any contacts; goliath temple.

## Frost Giant Castle
Ruled by Jarl Storvald. INT10. Super strong.
Invites them to food and mead

Once eating, goliaths serve them, then casually mention:
- Jarl: Sure is plenty of meat this time of year.
- Sansuri: Yes, dear, but do remember what this means
- Jarl: Ja. Vi have poerful enemies ahead. But that is NO REASON for us to reject such what nature has given us at the heart of the dark season, no less.

Tell them they are welcome to food and celebrations. Tarsakh is upon them. Birth of the new year. Marked in six days by the longest night. Mention meaning of the name Boreal Valley.

### Policies
Some goliath's subservient to them, and help foraging and retrieving protection money from IWD. Also have a few Frost Giants out there as muscle.

## Status
Increasing military spending. Upgrading blades. Words from Waterdeep to prepare for anything (drag gnoll corpse).
Ultimately no help from coast right now, they are too defensive.
Coast also wants diamonds, but trade lines are cut off.

### Gnoll Hook
They don't know how long until, or if Yeenoghu attacks. But they can locate it with tremor sensing instruments left behind (netherese tech). Use the lair template from Luskan.

### Rumors
Goliaths know about Kavaki, and the Old Witch. Most of the healthy and powerful, but subjugated, and happy where they are. Even though many of the frost giants are a bit brash (calling them by their nicknames, Stonecarver, Flintwalker, Foodleaper, Bravechaser).

An older Goliath `Kanapath Kulumathala`. (Other goliath will suggest calling her `Truthweaver` instead)

- on Akkhan: The Slain Saint. The strongest of them all. Dead, buried, forgotten.
- on Akkhan's Burial / Diamond Mine: "At the last noon of Alturiak, Farron Peak shows the way." (oddly sheer peak atop a smaller mountain on the west side of the range, rises almost like a rectangle for about 50m~ below a final snow topped crest).
- on healthcare / or Faron Peak: Old Witch cures all (cannot say for a price, twitches)
- on Giants

People know of a witch doctor living up there; the Old Witch (baba yaga).
=> they can go ask her for secrets (at horrific costs), or wait for noon in the valley and watch the shadow strike where the door is buried.


### Baba Yaga's Hut
#### Scary Zone
Halucinatory terrain. They'll see things. Trees drop a mist of snowy particles on you. Head spinning. Message from Sansuri halfway throughout. "Is everything OK?, I've lost you on the scry"
    "oh, no, she knows you, this is... THIS IS WHERE YOU DIE."
Jumpscare between the trees. Trees stomp around like legs.
Mordai's parents casting them out. Seeing her mother throw you out.

#### Inside
Only one can enter at a time. If battle, her entire hut will retreat into the scary zone, leaving the player with a curse.

Creeping senility or Dissolution, Parched (exhaustion).
https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/artifacts/major-artifacts/dancing-hut-of-baba-yaga/

She's a hag who can teleport with her enormous mortar and pestle.
Huge wave of black thick hair, two  enormous thiefling horns, and purple skin. Braid of brown decaying fangs worn draped from her horns like a beard. She turns towards you with her enormous nouse and two small dull grey eyes with only tiny dots as pupils.
Trades secrets for Akkhan's crossbow, or a passage to the feywild. "Wish to see my bethrothed Eladrin (Ara Genris, a noble overseeing the operations of the Watchers, always been the first to shy away from altercations with the Fomorians.), or some way to sell out Felgolos, perhaps add 10 years to one player - who then loses one DEX (not fixed by greater restoration).
Will reveal to the cleverer party members that she simply values the essence of life. "Looks, health, and power is important, but pain, suffering and injustice is the fuel of life that makes one fight. I give people a little bit of both."

## Wilderness
- Dire Wolves
- Snowy Owlbears
- Ychen Bannog TOB413 CC11 gargantuan oxen, 2x

## Goliath Mine
A dried up local source of diamonds. Converted to be a tourist attraction for goliaths from Luskan in better times, Akkhan buried there around the same time, who was a great inspiration to everyone in the region. Made diamond rings and rods for magic practicioners.

Necromancers tried to raise Akkhan in a cultist ritual to bring back the good times, but it went disastrously wrong. Now the undead patron saint of Kavaki roams the halls, drained the life of everyone still inside, and demands utmost servitude. He demanded the goliaths guard the entrance until they died of hunger, the dwarves kept mining till their death, and the netherese elves keep making diamond trinkets (which fill his chamber) - however, due to spells have been kept alive. Fortified themselves up north west.

Now it's sealed off. Created a rock fall over the castle doors, then it froze over. Auril has maintained an unending winter over the area anyway. On winter solstice, the low light of the sun across a

### Dungeon
![](boreal-mine.jpg)

Passive dungeon. Traps. Puzzles. Netherese Tech.
Mechanic; must unseal the evil befallen the tomb. Must release the elves from their creation, dwarves from their mining, goliaths from their guarding (either by killing all of them, or by destroying ???). The elves/dwarves/goliaths therein are weak, hungry, but will use the environment to defend themselves. Escaping and unleashing traps from the ceiling. Rolling boulders.

Tombs all empty early on. They were graves to fallen miners. Tombs later on are for revenants.
Elven factory has diamond cutters. They are pretty intricate pieces of technology from the netherese empire (lasers, that must remain plugged in). Top left room has 5 lasers.

Maybe something like a phaerim: https://dmdave.com/phaerimm/
heals on spell damage. Maybe make it more construct like. Green obleisk like pillars (what looks like tomb stones). Unleashes lightning to nearby enemies when the dungeon is activated (happens when the elves do it).

### Dwarven enclave
Top left. All three doors barricaded. They live there. 2nd/3rd generation dwarves. They have a secret passage out to the wilderness, and a mushroom farm underneath.
Motivation: Trying to fix the evil befallen the tomb.
How: TODO: Slowly undoing the magic???

Knows of Akkhan's burial, knows they dug forever without finding fire.
=> So they made a twisted imitation of it instead.
They avoid the top caverns, lost too many dwarves there. They know of ways to avoid the water worm?
They know of both water ways to the unholy forge. They tell them about the drilldozer if they ask, but it's lacking its activation gem, it was lost in one of the northern tunnels.

### Water Worm
Walking into the water activates BORE WORM CR16 (5e.tools)
It will just drill its way through, having them take a grinding attack, 4 times as they pass through.

Damage can't be avoided unless they are break into the two sarcophagi.
DEX 25 vs 40 bludgeoning dmg. Everyone in the tight corridor.

Foreshadowing, once they step in, they start hearing the ground shake, rocks fall from further within the water cave, and they suddenly see the face of the bore worm rise from within the tunnel and start pushing forward.

If they escape out to the open, it burrows and retreats back.

### Being watched
By an Urochar TOB393 CR17 strangler tentacle aberration: tentacle leap.
Foreshadowing: dark, slithery sounds, rocks fall from the ceiling at different times.
Perception 25, they see something slither away.
Not super dangerous despite CR17, unless they split up.
More likely to attack in the little digger caves.
Foreshadowing tunnels, crushed bones, in a weird pile (like someone had a meal; high inv)

### Forge Guardians
Bottom right.
TODO: This needs to have more of a twisted fire feel...

- TANK: Tophet TOB383 golem with hearth in its belly
- Guardian monolith: AC20 100HP. Filled with magical energy. Abjuration. Evocation. Inscription.
> Monolith: Kindle and comply.

Need to feed a weapon ot the tank or else it activates when they touch the door.
It puts a forcecage around the room, and renders him invulnerable to all damage until the monlith is destroyed.

### Drilldozer
Deactivated Golem, War Machine (reskin to driller) CC205 CR18. 6ft wide.
Parked top left door facing right.
Needs an activation gem found in one of the graves/side-tunnels. Whichever they see first.
Can only be used for drilling. But can create a path through to Akkhan without disturbing the worm.

### Akkhan
> Eyes burning blue within the helmet of the dwarf.

Death Knight with modified Hellfire Orb (radiant/necrotic damage instead).
Immune to all damage. Due to crystals in the room. Can be stunned or held though.
Maybe he can speak like Aetera in Divinity2.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu-nS9_wC6M

Weapon;
- Maul +3. Condemn on Crit.
- Heaven's Fury (+3 Radiant shotgun (2d8), 5 attacks per hour), hits in 3 arcs, 60 deg differentiated.
[[sunset-warriors]]

While he is a Brute/Infantry

Minions:
- Artillery/Glass: Skein Witch TOB349 (ex-celestial corrupted servant): Bind Fates, then Threads/Wave
- Artillery: 4x Dream Squires with crossbows (absorbs spells); CC134


Find a piece of Kiaransalee's scythe blade within. Increased corruption.
Fights in sole chamber. If attacked, elves from nearby rooms rush in to help Akkhan.

### Lore
Akkhan worked with Umnos on dwarven forgeries.

#### Gilgrin remnants
Architectural style looking like Gilgrin. But shoehorned on top of a mine.
No forge (no lava, they were hoping to find it, being so close to Gilgrin).
No traces of giants.

#### Search for the Flame
Journal of 15 year search for fire through various charted deep dive digs in search of volcanic activity. Looks like the area beneath this mountain has been thoroughly perforated, to depths of up to 1500m. It's a sad read, interspersed with hundreds of names of fallen dwarves who participated in the search.

There are also a lot of references to a place called Jiksidur.

#### Fire & Lies; inflammatory posturing of `Wrufius`
Written by `Grymin Wordbraids` about the fire giant trump:

> Details a campaign wherein a fire giant named Wrufius argued for fire giant supremacy and how the dwarves who guarded the gates to menzo were taking advantage of the hospitality of the storm and cloud giants. It talks about how he talked about how the fire giants had been supplanted by less skilled and cheaper workers, and preached to the frost giants how eventually this trend of alleged infiltration would continue; the dwarves (he claimed) would replace their defensive work by hiring cheaper goliaths (essentially subcontracting), and start charging them more and more for weapons even though they were made in a forge owned by giants.
> Most of the quotes of Wrufius are literal giant, gw can at least see see there's a certain word play tied up in the giant language and a certain element is certainly lost in translation, but the included translation within the book shows pretty clearly that it's using pretty slanderous techniques; moving quickly from case to case of examples without proving them, in a manner that sounds pretty conspiratorial.
> It becomes clear as you read this that the book was written in lieu of the fire giant takeover of Gilgrin 560y ago from dates. The dwarves were forcefully squeezed out with authoritarian policing by the frost giants on new terms from Halos.

#### Apology letter to Akkhan from Umnos
From Umnos. An apology letter that doesn't feel like a real apology

> Letter with a broken and cracked seal made out of blue candle wax which embosses an intricate letter U:

> Akkhan. It brings me great pain that it has come to this. Our work was that of radiance and lightning. I still don't understand how just a few bad dwarves would bring our great partnership to an end in such a way.
> I understand most of you are in the process of restoring the old diamond mine. With your leadership, I expect it will be a place of great prosperity, and where we can find a more equal partnership once you are all established there.
> Should you need help, the frost giants are available for hire.
> I hope that one day we can put this behind us.
> Umnos
