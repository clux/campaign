## Original story
To the uninformed eye, Castle Never looks like a big, hulking ruin. Half its towers fell in the cataclysm, and the wall on its seaward side crumbled to rubble. Chunks of stone and fallen statues litter the windswept courtyard. Inside, the stone corridors stink of ash and dust, which swirls up around the feet of intruders. Even in their emptiness, the corridors never seem vacant. The spirits of the hundreds who died here linger on.

An imposing fixture of Neverwinter’s western end, Castle Never stands as a monument to the city’s former glory. The cataclysm struck it hard, toppling towers, collapsing walls, and starting fires that burned throughout the structure. The entire royal family is thought to have perished, and the remaining servants sealed the vaults, crypts, and grounds with the hope that a worthy heir to Neverwinter would arrive one day to take his or her rightful place on the throne. On that day, it is said, the magic treasures and other resources of the castle will serve the new ruler.

The courtyard of Castle Never bears the traces of a camp that was well hidden but has become increasingly obvious from frequent use. The camp originally belonged to an infamous pair of drow: Drizzt Do’Urden, legendary ranger of the North, and the less well-regarded Jarlaxle, captain of the Bregan D’aerthe mercenaries. The two drow were in the area when the cataclysm claimed Neverwinter, and they still have interests in the region. Specifically, they are looking for clues to tie up a Thayan loose end from their last mission. The drow established this camp as a base of operations in Neverwinter, enabling them to keep an eye on their schemes in the city.

 ### Hall of Ashen Mirrors
Full-length mirrors once adorned the walls of this long corridor, wherein young heirs of Alagondar practiced their noble gait and posture. The mirrors shattered in the cataclysm, instantly killing anyone in the corridor at the time, just before a wave of searing gas blasted through the huge windows and turned the corpses to ash. This double catastrophe left the hallway a wasteland of soot and splintered glass.

### Neverneath, Endless Maze
The catacombs beneath Castle Never came through the cataclysm mostly untouched, thanks to a warding spell commissioned in times past to maintain the structural integrity of the castle. However, the Spellplague wrought strange changes upon the ward, which has grown in strength as a result of the seeping influence of the active plague deep under the earth. What once protected the catacombs now traps intruders.

### The Inner Vault
The inner vault of the Nine is a simple stone chamber sealed tight with the sigil of Neverwinter carved in its great stone doors. Within, nine marble coffins ring a central throne emblazoned with a sun; the coffins stand as its rays. The throne and the coffins glimmer with dim, warm light to illuminate a chamber carved with idyllic images of summer. In the vault, winter never falls, just as it never did during the time of the nine heroes here entombed.

## Gnoll motivation
Family. Raiding. Warriors. Hate the slaad. Feed sick gnolls to girallions.

## Gnoll NPC – Dizz
Wants Flind's flail so he can replace him. If he can be assassinated without anyone seeing it. He is. Watch for shooshuuva. Pet dog. Don't kill it please. Mine. From Baator. Works if they're stealthing.

Sneak in when sleeping. Release big apes. Sneak into his chamber when he leaves.

## Gnoll Capture
- If they get captured. Take weapons, throw in armory. Keep one behind.
- Torrg (better flind) will want them to assassinate the Grey. (Thinks that will make them break ranks).
- "How we know you not run away?"
- "Torrg better idea. Torrg and best warriors guard entrance to slaad. You return with grey head. You live."

## Slaad society
One death/grey rules. Rest mostly blue / reds. Makes order out of chaos. Fixes up the situation. Makes more slads.

## Aboleth fight
Death slaad: fireball. Then really wail on Zed. +11 to hit. Fear from corner! Major image to lure them in. He's hiding in one pool of water.
Enslave (use slack on the Wis save, 15DC – indicate eye shift)
Use it on spellcasters, then wail on Zed, then the Flind.
Slaad will protect the aboleth – but if they fail the hitting throw, it will go underwater. Down towards underdark.
Aboleth lair action will use the water attack all the time.
Aboleth will enslave. Zed/Flind. Then Tail swipe/pshycic drain on un-ensalved targets
Have a few grey cloaks there as enslaved. Buff Aboleth a bit in enrage? Go into ephemeral mode and gain Nihileth resistances.
