# Sunset Warriors
The champions of the east that bested Kiaransalee in Aruanoch 700y ago.
Shario + Akkhan + Sunwuko + Natalya.

## Items
Felgolos has Shario's Bracers + Akkhan's Ring
Some of Sharia's loot is in Halos, some in Waterdeep.
Sunwuko has one item in Halos, rest in shrine in eastern monastery.

## Akkhan
The original champion of [[kavaki]].
Tomb in a diamond mine - near boreal temple / icewind dale.

### Items
- Heaven's Fury (Radiant energy d3 shotgun) helmet
Whenever hit with weapon, it hits with the power of kavaki in 3 directions
60 degree differentiation from center. Each beam carries same damage. So can in theory triple damage output. __in tomb__
- Ring of Comdemnation (Can cast Comdemn 30ft radius con save vs 8d8 radiant dmg as an action once per day) __felgolos__

- +3 Two Handed Flail 2d6 (Golden Scourge - Divine Smite bounces 10 feet to up to 3 additional creatures) - an attempt to recreate Akkhan's weapon. Needs a 5th level radiant damage spell imbued plus the soul of Akkhan / 1000gp opal. Needs 21 strength __felgolos partial recreate__

NB: Heaven's fury stacks with Golden Scourge (so can do 3x3 smite hits against AoE)

### Tomb Boss
Death Knight Akkhan: https://i.redd.it/n9kv95j532y41.jpg
Failure here can turn GW into a villain death knight?

## Sunwuko
Shrine in Sunset Mountains - South of Netheril (in ruins)
Netheril east/west border is undead territory.

Sunwuko a master monk ruled the City of Shade. They had developed a completely different style of fighting to combat the stun-proof elites of the undead; avoidance, drain, + fast shooting weaponry (auto-reload crossbows).

Worshipped the Monkey King. Incredible agility gave him great prowess in battle and dancing.

### Items
- weapon that burns spell on crit roll D8+1 for level slot, but can only slow instead of stun. Gives truesight.
- spirit stone: grant Breath of Heaven spell (heal all allies within 30 ft - ~25% of monk's health)
- auto-reloading crossbow (generate ki on hits, cannot stun while equipped?)
- Divine Rapier +2 (Cannot miss unless disadvantaged + amplifies dodge action, becomes completely immune to damage) __Halos__

TODO: something that nerfs stun, but perhaps boosts health regen/survivability?

### Tomb Boss
Solar programmed to not let anyone sully the burial site (knows if it hears a lie). Tons of destroyed skeletons nearby (that have tried).

## Shario
Burial chamber central to the mage's guild. Ursula takes the full lore and takes it to heart.
Diana + the others know the story, but considers it a fairy tale.

In Castle Waterdeep. But you can't just loot it unless there's a distraction happening. City guard elite near at hand.

Celestial god helped bury her. Kavaki was her champion. Selune.
Shario Dyunōru. Was buried here, she has the amulet around her neck + key in arm. They grab key, unleashing some radiant energy. Ditto amulet.

### Items
- Shario's Bracers of Evocation (Boosts Evocation Spells, extra dmg dice to all spells of level > 0) __Felgolos__
- Moonlight Ward: When receiving fatal damage, you are instead restored to 100% maximum life and resources. The item is then rendered unmagical for the next 100 years __Burial Chamber__
- Ring of Lightning (Boosts lightning bolt Damage +2d6) __Ursula__
- Ring of Fire (Boosts Fireball range and damage, +20ft, +2d6) __Halos__

## Natalya
Arch-huntress and ruler of the Zemnian Empire. Not religious. Draconic pets. Knew Felgolos. Not known where she was buried.
and her legendary longbow.

### Items
- Kridershot: +3 (explosive bolts +d6 radiant damage)
- Yang's Recurve +3 (crit pulls enemies 15ft - 30ft pull range)
- Boots of Haste
- Elusive Ring (after using your reaction, you have resistance to all damage for one round) __Ursula__

## Kiaransalee's Resting Place
Ex-netherese Empire beneath Acropolis of Thanatos in V'elddrinnsshar.

### Mechanics
Magically imbued scythe. Egg of Galadaeros (aka the Eternal Star) compressed as the pommel (given to the Arcane Brotherhood to protect).
Iridium Blade of Shadow, buried with Shario.
Staff of Thunder and Lightning (used to belong to Umnos, but he sealed it in Gilgrin) ((perhaps make it lightning only, but higher stun DC))

Could not be charmed, could not be stunned, and could not be transformed in any way. Attacks out of nothing (invis), and when angry.

### Lore
The Crones of Thanatos was the cult dedicated to her worship. Primarily surface drow in the east. Dressed in loose black robes, gray skullcap. At least one silver ring on each hand. Faces smeared with a mix of ashes, white hourglass necklace around their neck.

Accomplished necromancers. Became Revenants, or Kiaranshee (elvish ghost type "keening spirit") - basically banshees with their wail. Cabrath Nelinderra. Undead priestess of Kiaransalee. Head priestess in the Acropolis of Thanatos.

Kiaransalee lost all her power when the hordes of her followers died in this clash (Helm Rift above the acropolis). Though the last remaining champion, Shario, distributed parts of her relics to various magocracies on the coast.

Graverending; Annual holy day of the faith. Midwinter Eve. Animated as many undead as each cleric could handle => became Vengeance Hunters and were set lose with this desire for revenge against those that ended their lives (had 24hours). The undead returned to their graves after 24h or after vengeance executed.

Held complete rule in the eastern coast of Faerun for several hundred years. Only after they started tearing down the netherese and zemnian empires that they encountered resistance (and it was only at the highest level were this was even considerable).

She saw any affront to her power as a symbol of the continued oppression from the elves against the dark elves, and were determined to use any of her slain dark elves against their enemies in undead form.

Learn about the final battle; a master monk from the city of shade, the ruler and arch-huntress of zemnia, the champion of the creator god kavaki, and shario, a master evoker from zemnia. Even with all these they had to battle hordes of undead, their wailing clerics.

After the battle, Shario herself ensured every member received a properly defended burial, and the powerful item they held protected so that they never fell into the wrong hands. (TALK ABOUT THE BURIAL CHAMBERS + ITEMS).

The staff, believed to be a staff of thunder, was in Gilgrin (the most secure, vault in the contintent), the pommel in the Luskan, the most powerful mages academy on the sword coast, and the blade of shadow in the most heavily defended blackstaff tower - at the heart of the city of splendor.
