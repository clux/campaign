# Evernight
Shadowfell version of [[neverwinter]].
![](evernight-map.jpg)

Only single spire left of Castle Nowhere.

Dark mist everywhere, you'd struggle to see anything if it wasn't for the bright orange light emanating from the river; all lava pouring down from the mountain.

Mordai's mansion lights blue (vampire manor).
