## Connections
- Road east to [[mirabar]].
- Road South to [[neverwinter]] (via [[toll-trolls]]).

## Intro
Later tremors + cracks as they approach north (Yeenaghu).

Gnolls being fought off at the gate. 100s of them. Gate almost breaking. Gate falling without help.
"Finally, reinforcements! We had word from Waterdeep that you were on your way. Arklem got a message from Diana."
Huge group of them blasted by fireball from the castle walls.
Vlooris is the robed guy.

(Drow members definitely all know about them know because of all the rucous in Waterdeep).
Also notorious with the Greycloaks + Bragan. Bonsir leads the militia there (also with ship rethnor)

## History
City was attacked repeatedly by orcs. They took over recently, but 50y ago a mercenary army from WDeep cleared the ruins. Rebuilt it with help of Neverwinter. Then renamed to Luskan.

So we can still have Brotherhood members who refer to it as Illusk.
Now full of Thieves/Pirates and other disreputable folk...

## Post Yeenoghu
Corruption spreads. People transform. Old watchers (ghostly guard) roam the city to clear out the corruption, but they treat everything as hostile.

### Watchers
Watchers of the Abyss rise to clear out corruption.
They fight against humans taken over so have a very heavy counter-humanoid style:
- shield guards rush into your face
- 2 more attack from the back
- 2 more shoot fire from the sides

along with Millwood Knights. Huge ogre like beasts in full armor and huge axes.
bowmen fortified in the distance

## Tower Arcane
Castle erected by Nelithanar. Was a spellward and huge stone walls that look like a tree now. Huge. Home to the academy for the Arcane Brothehood.

Mages have color suffixes. Kazhen the Red.

Discounts: -15% per rank

#### Initiation
THEY ALREADY ROBBED MANISION IN WATERDEEP

#### Short quest
Via [[beniago]].
So, you're clearly pretty thieves already, but you haven't technically accomplished any tasks for us, so I will give you a freebie. We will grant you Swashbuckler rank if;
- Get Orena + Zanu drunk.

Drinking contest / deception / magic.

#### Alternate Short quest
Steal something pointless from the captain.

#### Long quest 2
Wants you to retrieve Araushnee's Stinger +3 dagger of Venom.

Defended by 2x Monolith Champions. Some of the most powerful constructs that we've seen. Anyone we've sent in has been dispatched with a blue flamed blade and our attacks might have pierced its armor, but after being hit, one of our mercenaries turned against us.

Beniago: "It's been hard to find people stupid enough to go in after that. Now, I realize I'm not making perhaps the most persuasive argument. But hear me out; my point is that we've seen you embark on quests most people have found foolish, and you've come out superior."

Keep what's in there. Quest for Faeynore? Drawings of Lolth.

Base dungeon on Dark Heart http://www.wizards.com/files/157_Dark_Heart.pdf - goes into the feywild post the obvious fake shrine parts.

Sell hit squads for N-thousand gold, depending on difficulty.

#### Final Long Quest
Find and recover main kidnapped leader + item in Menzo.
Or perhaps ruathym?

#### EBA Quest
Steal item from Mages Guild to frame someone. (Stealing totally bad idea against scrying mage).
If they get caught, he will add a parasite into the skull of the caught thief. -4 INT until removed + clairvoyance info. Want Cat Ear Headband stolen.
Alternatively, steal a ring and frame another ship?

### Yeenoghu's Lair
Dissuage them from trying.

- "We're hoping they'll run out of reinforcements and move on."
- "If we aggravate their leader, we are probably in bigger rouble..."
- "Don't bring the leader back here. If you have to flee, flee elsewhere..."

Nothing for 2/3 nights, then more gnolls.
4th night, giant crack, city falls down into the deep. Yeenoghu eats everyone except the mages.

However, **if they do descend**:
Huge corridor, that starts with large crushing sounds, followed by 50 gnolls.
Corridor partially made by purple worm (but yeenaghu can burst through tiny openings pretty  easily)
Then silence. Chanting gnoll voice: Yeenoghu (3 times). 5 seconds of silence, then this deathly roar.
Then gradually more frequent steps, and Yeenoghu comes..

- Spirtual weapon flail conc!
- Legendary actions: Swat (huge push D24 STR), bite (huge dmg melee)

- Immune to charm/frightened/poisoned..

**Fight area**: Purple worm tunnel, they can retreat into soft areas a purple worm nursery. They can also hide in there if they find it early and roll decent stealth.
