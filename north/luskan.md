# Luskan

## Connections
- Road east to [[mirabar]].
- Road South to [[neverwinter]].

## Post Yeenoghu
Corruption spreads. People transform. Old watchers (ghostly guard) roam the city to clear out the corruption, but they treat everything as hostile.

### Watchers
Watchers of the Abyss rise to clear out corruption.
They fight against humans taken over so have a very heavy counter-humanoid style:
- shield guards rush into your face
- 2 more attack from the back
- 2 more shoot fire from the sides

along with Millwood Knights. Huge ogre like beasts in full armor and huge axes.
bowmen fortified in the distance

## Tower Arcane
Castle erected by Nelithanar. Was a spellward and huge stone walls that look like a tree now. Huge. Home to the academy for the Arcane Brothehood.

Mages have color suffixes. Kazhen the Red.

### Sydney's Initiation
Show them how to do basic spells and teach them how to do damage in a controlled test chamber. Meet a HR person. Sheirah / Sydney. Annoying mean girls voice. Purple shirt, well cut, uniformed skirt. Purple curly hair. Infernal heritage.

"Ucghs.. More wannabees." (Perc10) Quick face change to a fake smile. "Hiii. Welcome to the mages guild brave adventurers. I'm Sydney, here to assess you before sending you up to the elders."

"We can't take you to Arklem, he's very busy. We gotta assess you first. If you do well you can maybe see Celerum."

"Look they can give proper info, I don't know why all the soldiers up there revere Arklem so much; Celerum is way more handsome. But seriously though, we just got to assess you first."

Assess strengths. Let's try a cantrip shall we? (Expects basic sorc)
Now let's show you what real strength is. She'll cast fireball into a haybale room.

"Ray of Enfeeblement" on the constructs. They look like their posture shrinks (lack of strength).
Keep using http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/spells and expect them to up the ante or keep up with the mean girl charade.

Magically fortified to reset on request (old brotherhood magic, mordenkainen's fortress?)
If they do well, they'll get a pretty high rank immediately.
(Terms and conditions, do not betray the brotherhood or you will lose your rank, all benefits, weave recharge booths, and wizard benefits cards). [valid in Gael's emporium + brothehood]

Ok, so you are powerful. (Gain faction rank). That (flips through rulebook frantically) still does not prove loyalty.
Send them on a quest down to exterminate the gnoll caverns. Bring us proof of their demise. Take out their leader and they should scatter.

## One Eyed Jax
Beniago's purple bird immediately kaws as you enter.
See [[beniago]] for the intro.

Discounts: -15% per rank

#### Initiation
THEY ALREADY ROBBED MANISION IN WATERDEEP

#### Short quest
Via [[beniago]].
So, you're clearly pretty thieves already, but you haven't technically accomplished any tasks for us, so I will give you a freebie. We will grant you Swashbuckler rank if;
- Get Orena + Zanu drunk.

Drinking contest / deception / magic.

#### Alternate Short quest
Steal something pointless from the captain.

#### Long quest 2
Wants you to retrieve Araushnee's Stinger +3 dagger of Venom.

Defended by 2x Monolith Champions. Some of the most powerful constructs that we've seen. Anyone we've sent in has been dispatched with a blue flamed blade and our attacks might have pierced its armor, but after being hit, one of our mercenaries turned against us.

Beniago: "It's been hard to find people stupid enough to go in after that. Now, I realize I'm not making perhaps the most persuasive argument. But hear me out; my point is that we've seen you embark on quests most people have found foolish, and you've come out superior."

Keep what's in there. Quest for Faeynore? Drawings of Lolth.

Base dungeon on Dark Heart http://www.wizards.com/files/157_Dark_Heart.pdf - goes into the feywild post the obvious fake shrine parts.

Reward
More access to items!
Sell hit squads for N-thousand gold, depending on difficulty.

#### Final Long Quest
Find and recover main kidnapped leader + item in Menzo.
Or perhaps ruathym?
