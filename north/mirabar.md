# Mirabar

Drug  making village. Near hill giant base. Captured inhabitants of Mirabar for food (they have been draining everything around as they've been neglecting their normal duties maintaining portal).
> "No one wins when giants fight"

### Drugs
- Epiphany: (weirdo vision (true sight // ethereal sight with chance), slow –dex/int + wis/cha)
- Anvil: (str adv, wis/cha disadv)
- Warp: (fast, +dex – int/wis)

Grumpy Hill giants watching over, collecting tax.
No means of sustainability. All from trading of barrels of drugs.

## Connections
- Road west to [[luskan]]
- Path to [[stormguard-citadel]]

## Hook
Giants are fucking them over.
Path down to underdark and Araj is now closely guarded.
Hint of allegiance between Drow + Giants

(ultimately untrustworthy alliance – giants corrupted, drow investigating as much as the next ones, but they have both participated in summoning the demon lords).
