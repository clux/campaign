see [[kiaransalee]] + [[irae]].
re-read session omega
fight styles highlighted from from [[dungeon-design]]

## music
### Orchestral Battle Music from Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VnTDYqbgxL0 (sounds good)
### Bleach Battle Music (Shiro Sagisu)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inqfVpkhI94 (maybe not, bit eclectic)
### Epic Battle Themes from Evangelion (Rebuild Edition)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KepiAite1hY (think this works..)

### Potential Innocent Start
See darkness form on the horizon. If they scry they can see her out on the farmlands:
slow, but large strides beneath sees a little curious girl on the outskirt farms.
"how would you like to live forever?"
**flesh tearing off in space of 10s**
small skeleton child, blue glowing eyes

## Stage 1: Arrogant Arrival
initial attack through **choke point**
but then
teleport within castle walls while skeletons attack
acid breath down a whole wall
-> **killing fields** fight
as she teleports inside she can run a DC20 CON save vs 50 necro dmg in area (if dead from this -> raise -> 10 graycloaks)
they can hide behind buildings in this stage, use the terrain

## Stage 2: Transformation
She blurs the line between the shadowfell and the prime material.
NB: This is using a lot of energy, so if she takes a lot of HP here it breaks.
Everything darkens, yellow soft glow becoming visible, soft moving sound of the neverwinter river fades, and your ears start picking up deeper rumbling sound instead.

Terrible creatures come in from the graveyard/tower in a way that overwhelms the graycloaks.
Adds a **fog of war** (reduces sight) to increase tension.

Maybe mages can come help at this point.
If they hide too much here; intorduce "The Lonely" add a soft

TODO: iz/raffolk soul cage tie in? [[epilogue]]?

## Stage 3: Desperation
Link between shadowfell breaks. Arrogance fades.
Final desperate gambit / boom or bust choice (that might kill people?) -> last chance to win.
Plot & BBEG merge
=> Irae tries to be the main face of Kiaransalee and speak as one
=> White face stuck (cannot switch, but has health?)
=> However, heavy penalties to her if plot subversion as even she cannot control a god
subversion: angering other 2 / or something else plot related? / sunset warrior attacks?

COULD have this be a cataclysmic event and they would have to battle through the city
recover allies, final inspirations
find mages at the bottom of halls of justice as they finish off undead allies



## Terrain
Vertical terrain: castle walls; smaller houses
Lava river in stage 2... can be diverted

## Denouement
Emotional Releases. [[epilogue]] lead ins.
