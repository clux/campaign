# Neverwinter v Kiaransalee
see [[kiaransalee]] + [[irae]].
re-read session omega
fight styles highlighted from from [[dungeon-design]]
## Stage 1: Arrogant Arrival
initial attack through **choke point**
but then
teleport within castle walls while skeletons attack
acid breath down a whole wall
-> **killing fields** fight

### Potential Innocent Start
She arrives, sees a little curious girl on the outskirt farms.
"how would you like to live forever?"
**flesh tearing off in space of 10s**
small skeleton child, blue glowing eyes

## Stage 2: Transformation
She blurs the line between the shadowfell and the prime material.
NB: This is using a lot of energy, so if she takes a lot of HP here it breaks.
Everything darkens, yellow soft glow becoming visible, soft moving sound of the neverwinter river fades, and your ears start picking up deeper rumbling sound instead.

Terrible creatures come in from the graveyard/tower in a way that overwhelms the graycloaks.
Adds a **fog of war** (reduces sight) to increase tension.

Maybe mages can come help at this point.

TODO: iz/raffolk soul cage tie in? [[epilogue]]?

## Stage 3: Desperation
Link between shadowfell breaks. Arrogance fades.
Final desperate gambit / boom or bust choice (that might kill people?) -> last chance to win.
Plot & BBEG merge. => Liches left?



### Stage 1
Going from Choke-Point -> Killing Fields () ?
Could do attack/defend but done that before. This should be test of mastery. She can port anyway.

Vertical terrain: castle walls; smaller houses

## Raised Undead battle Graycloaks
