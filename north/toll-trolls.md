# Toll Trolls
Trolls franchising the bridge crossing north from Neverwinter.
Subscription fees available, but for newcomers, there's the basic fee, which these trolls are demanding.

If battle; They are both Giants (Fire-ish stats) but give them a very strong regeneration (full per round)
Unless standing in Fire (Grog) / Poison (Marg)
Lines more or less straight out of Divinity 2.

## Developments
- Grog thrown off bridge polymorphed
- GW on scenic route just paid Marge the 3g
- Pendle on most scenic route finds a non-canonical third troll Grax
- Pendle tries to bullshit the troll about princes. The troll wants a gem for the bridge to cross. Pendle introduces the troll to the concept of credit. Pendle can cross the bridge, and Hjarka will pay for it. "Hjarka is identifiable by her trident and island aesthetic".

## Grog
### Reactions
- An enormous, unusually, red troll looms over you with his fists clenched threatenlingly. Hix expression is stern, yet you can see the tiniest twinkle in his intelligent eyes.
- He smiles a jagged and magnanimous grin. Each pitchfork-pointed toooth
- He rubs his leathery hands together with glee.
- His eyes narrow to glinting slits, and a deep laugh shakes his whole frame.

### Lines
- Grog: Back off, pigeon. This is my bridge... and I don't suffer fools on it.
- Grog: Didn't hear me the first time, parrot?
- Maybe -> Grog: We'll see. You want to cross my bridge.
- Ok -> hehe. Sure. One regular-priced bridge crossing coming right up. 5000gp.

### Attempts
Deception 20: Look behind you. -> He turns for one round.
Persuasion 20: Lower the cost. -> 4997

Asking for lowering -> Grog: Ahhahah. Aha. There is one thing you can do.
- Grog: The competition. Take out my competition and I could waive the usual fee.
- Grog: A little magpie-feather named Marg. He's not fit to be a bridgekeeper.
- Grog: He took over the other bridge across... and he's too cheap! I can't compete with his ridiculous prices.
- Maybe -> Grog: That's a little non-committal... but I'll take what I can get around here.
- Ok -> Grog draws a rough map in the dust of the bridge with one claw. He then spends an inordinate amount of time sketching a highly vulgar doodle of this Marg he wants you to take care of.
- Grog: There! Now for the moment, you'll need to back off. No pay, no stay.

## Marg
Marg bats his eyelashes at you. You can't ttell whether he is serious or not.
He smirks as he rases tree-trunk sized arms overhead and lunges for you. Somehow, you get the feeling that you're actually giving him what he really wanted all along: an enemy.
Resting his kindly face on steepled fingers, Marg eagerly awaits your song.

Quest reward: Big Diamond.
Next crossing will be at 5k gold again!

### Lines first meet
- Marg: Oh hello there. A fine day it is. And the finest day for a wee saunter through the trees it is too. Not even any giants left to spoil it.
- Asking about Grog: Isn't a healthy business environment just wonderful? Grog and his pathetic bridge give me just the little kick of competition I need to improve my service... and increase my prices.

Revealing Grog quest: He WHAT? After all we've been through together?
Morg: Truly, who has the finer bridge here? You should be working on eliminating the weakest link! Which in case it isn't crystal clear â€“ is Grog.
Ok -> Well. Good!
No -> If you're not a paying customer, I'm afraid I'll have to ask you to leave. (even after killing)

## Outcomes
### Back to Grog after Marg
Grog: Back so soon? I said get rid of him, not natter with him like two old ladies. Kill him.. Kill him now!
Killing Grog: Traitor! Turncoat. Tattletale.

### Killing Grog and returning to Marg
Marg: Aren't you just my favourite person today? Business  can be rough sometimes, but paying customers like you make it all worth it.
Marg: I've even been thinking lately, about improving my business. Grog had some... interesting ideas, so I'll be trying out some of his policies. Let me know how you like them. I always value the feedback of my treasured customers.

### Paying Marg straight up
Marg: Ah, you again! Got the coin to pass, have you?
Trying to pass -> Oooohh, not so fast! I do try to be nice about it and all that, but this bridge is Marg's business.
Yes -> Oh, just the best. Just the bee's knees, really.
I've made more money today than in the last month combined, thanks to a group of mercenaries who were in such a hurry they didn't have any time to haggle.
Who -> A group of mercenaries who scurried north earlier. Dark skin, cloaks. They paid a handsome toll too! Glory, what a marvellous day!

Price reveal: Since it is such a fine day, I can let you pass at a discount if you entertain me with a song from your adventures. Otherwise? Full price (3gp).
Performance -> Wide-eyed, Marg nods in appreciation at your tale.
Good -> Now THAT's a good song! For that you can pass for a pittance! (1gp)
Over you go... and be sure to appreciate the bewitching views as you cross my magnificent bridge!

## Grax
Improv troll that built its own bridge and wants gems for crossing.
