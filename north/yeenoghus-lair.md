# Yeenoghu's Lair
Forgotten Caverns U map.
Start in huge corridor. Ominos large crushing sounds, followed by 50 gnolls.
Corridor partially made by purple worm (but yeenoghu can burst through tiny openings pretty  easily)
Then silence. Chanting gnoll voice: Yeenoghu (3 times). 5 seconds of silence, then this deathly roar.
Then gradually more frequent steps, and Yeenoghu comes..

**Fight area entrance**: Cave complex 500ft underneath the Boreal Valley. Get there through a purple worm tunnel, they can retreat into soft areas a purple worm nursery. They can also hide in there if they find it early and roll decent stealth.

## Intro
Cavern opens up from the purple worm tunnel.
Different texture to the rock here, not a lot of heavy rock. Mostly clay.
However, as the cavern opens, huge iron spikes coming out of the ground. Impaled through one of them is the skull of a canine figure, picked clean, apart from one eye dangling from the socket.
Huge stomp. Small quake. Rubble falling from the ceiling.
Ceiling: It's mostly dry due to the temperature, but you see holes them, about 3ft wide circular holes.
Stomp: Sounded like it came southward.
Spikes: One is retracting.

#### Damage
E(Hit) = > 90% on everyone except GW (maybe less with Shield and blinks)
E(Hit|GW haste) = 50% (haste => 22AC, and passive disadv)

NO: Yee E(DMGX2DICE) = 0.9*(21*3) + 26 = 83 (awful vs people, but can pick paralyze/confusion)
Yee E(DMG) = 0.9*(15*3) + 13 = 53 (dangerous vs everyone else)
Yee E(DMG|GW) = 0.5*(15*3) + 13(extra dmg effect) = 29 (better to paralyze attempt)
Also got one bite attack legendary (x2 actions) for extra 14.
Last action: extra charge or a reaction swat. Make it a flail attack..
Put a crit in there.

Invisibility enrage. Dispel out of it
