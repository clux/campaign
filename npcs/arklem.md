# Arklem Greeth
Grand archmage of [[arcane-brotherhood]] + Grand Extender of [[undying-soul]].

A 750 year old wizard turned lich, that just keeps Modify Memory / Glibness at super high level at people to make them feel like he's not that old / telling the truth.

Been harnessing the power of the Eternal Star (Irae), and growing increasingly careless over the years as his power has been unchecked.

Arklem Greeth would have wanted to appeal to their evil sides:
- What do you want out of this situation?
- What can you do for us? We can teach you any magic you like.

But now he has all the power he needs with the Egg and Liches in allegiance(?)
Arklem doesn't want to be found - anti-scry ritual.

## Development
- Took out Orcus' ship and stole his Wand
- Teleported to Irae's phylactery from the ship (and with heavy buffs, attuned to the wand)
- Stole the Egg of Galadaeros during Yeenoghu's assault on Luskan
- Was spotted by Celerom

## Irithyll Setup
Knows that the sentience enjoyed by the undead is a cursed one. Inevitably they will go mad, and at a rate much faster than liches (as they don't feed on souls).
He was stonewalling [[celerom]] from making his case in [[irithyll]] for as long as possible through the vampire council.
Continued confusion (geas) on the vampire council there.
Wants plan to progress quickly now that demon lords are weakened and have started to fall plus Orcus lost.

He wants adventurers dead, and taken by koth or zug, so the shadowfell army can rise unimpeded and Irae can activate the powers of [[kiaransalee]] in [[velddrinnsshar]]

### Plans
Doesn't know they are there due to Nondetection, but has plans for eventualities.

### Ambush Summon Party
Koth' summoned high end adventurers; undead arch druids et al. See [[path-of-suffering]].
This will happen if they traverse out of there manually (which they have to unless they luck on Arcana due to the Ward).

## Stats
Mostly, normal lich.
Lair actions tether to low hp party member to split damage.
Deters paladin. If you can't tether, use the spirits.

## Items
Something that give a sorcerer wizard capabilities.
Cross reference with tasha.
Arcane Grimoire +3 Spell DC
Robe of the Archmagi +2 Spell DC/SAVE
Quill of Scribing? Can scribe any spell you can cast?
Or just Heart Weaver's Primer (Some cool wiz spells, mind control related)

He has Wand of Orcus.

## Combos
- Paralyzing touch into disintegrate (meh, not really fun)
- Globe of invuln vs counterspell
- Save counterspell against mages (dont bother for forcecage)
- Debate shield vs counterspell

Boosts: bump hp to 200 (max range). Potion of invulnerability.
Bind hitpoints to golem (shield guardian).
Staff of power +2 ac, spell attacks, spell dc.
Black robes of the archmagi, base ac 15 +2 spell dc, adv spell saves
Ioun stone of absorption
Switch spells around. Meteor Swarm over PWK. Prismatic spray.
Prismatic Wall over PWK. Circle of Death 6th level.
Maximize cantrip damage.

dio style lines; "Oh you're approaching me? Instead of running away, you are coming right at me?" -> "Then come as close as you like X."

## Phylactery
Situated within the [[penthacoron]].
If he's killed he'll spawn therein, but it'll be another `N` years?

Pocket plane within.
Mummies roam the tomb. Mummy lord and Iron Golems in final room.
If inner doors is breached, one of many permanent alarms are triggered.
Then they get to fight both Arklem and a mummy lord.
Revamped tomb of horrors? That one young youtuber had a revamp idea of it.

## History
Netherese wizard. Served Larloch the Shadow King. He was the one who helped Irae become a lich.

## Alliances
Lich in bed with Valindra Shadowmantle.
Husband of the former Valindra Shadowmantle. Went to Thay with several items, to reunite with Valindra. He has a deal with Irae. He'll get Neverwinter? They share phylactery?

## Tower Arcane
Holds the top area at the tower. Given control over Yeenoghu for Eternal Star.

> Let me tell you a story. Illusk was once the peal of the north, the major trading outpost that everyone saught towards when designing their ports. Now, we are a pack of pirate crews and "ships" that have to do our business under shady guises because of the regulations imposed on us via the new "trading capital of Amn". The ships of their mercanary company "the flaming fist" roam the seas, and their cannons massively outnumber the power output of our fleets. Even if we put some of our most powerful mages in charge on the ship.

We would like to restore the city to its former position as the prime trading outpost on the sword coast. So.. Now you know what I want. What can you do for us?
