# Arklem Greeth
Arch mage and lich of the former Tower Arcane.
Actually 750 year old wizard turned lich, that just keeps Modify Memory / Glibness at super high level at people to make them feel like he's not that old / telling the truth.

Been harnessing the power of the Eternal Star (Irae), and growing increasingly careless over the years as his power has been unchecked.

Arklem Greeth would have wanted to appeal to their evil sides:
- What do you want out of this situation?
- What can you do for us? We can teach you any magic you like.

But now he has all the power he needs with the Egg and Liches in allegiance(?)
Arklem doesn't want to be found - anti-scry ritual.

## Development
- Stole the Egg of Galadaeros during Yeenaghu's assault on Luskan
- Was spotted by Celerom

## Alliances
Lich in bed with Valindra Shadowmantle.
Husband of the former Valindra Shadowmantle. Went to Thay with several items, to reunite with Valindra. He has a deal with Irae. He'll get Neverwinter? They share phylactery?

## Tower Arcane
Holds the top area at the tower. Given control over Yeenoghu for Eternal Star.

> Let me tell you a story. Illusk was once the peal of the north, the major trading outpost that everyone saught towards when designing their ports. Now, we are a pack of pirate crews and "ships" that have to do our business under shady guises because of the regulations imposed on us via the new "trading capital of Amn". The ships of their mercanary company "the flaming fist" roam the seas, and their cannons massively outnumber the power output of our fleets. Even if we put some of our most powerful mages in charge on the ship.

We would like to restore the city to its former position as the prime trading outpost on the sword coast. So.. Now you know what I want. What can you do for us?
