# Celerum
A more likely helper. Master mage.

Tall, thin 1.9m blond hair blue eyes. Fine black robes, jewel-inlaid golden belt. Ambitious, and calculating, but ultimately intelligent and knew that his position would not let him do anything to further his goals without finesse.

Now has a beard. Robe a bit more torn.

Celerum was ambitious, arrogant, cold, and calculating. He was completely devoid of morals and would do anything to further his goals.

Detected unusually strong conjuration energy at Stormguard Citadel. Sent them there to investigate.

Spell researcher, helped out with Chronomancy, and scried. Ported out to Neverwinter during the attack. Doesn't want to go to Waterdeep.

Saw Yeenoghu smash his way through the cities defenses and smash a huge hole in the center of the tower arcane.

Didn't know Arklem was a lich (glibness...), but saw him steal the star, so is, and saw Irae/Herald raise a whole civilization of intelligent undead and struck a deal with her (she Modify Memory'd him).

Ally of Arklem and Irae (unnamed for him) in the east now. Perhaps he can be convinced otherwise when they meet him in [[bonecity]]. He wants some privacy first and foremost while researching the undead reversal/reunification.

Built the city with Mighty Fortress spell and magic in Bone Dome.
Has a clone of himself in Irithyll ready to take over if he dies.
Had an attack on [[bonecity]] from a Devil. Large horns and everything. Saw a humanoid outside scurry away on a griffin leaving behind a fragments of a high level spell scroll (Arcana: devils cannot enter realm alone).

## Encounters
- [[55-brotherhood]] Initial meeting in Tower Arcane, Questioning Goatweaver's morality
- [[56-drinking-culture]] Celerom has the book of Chronomancy
- [[57-mirabar]] Teaching Mordai Chronomancy
- [[70-waterdeep]] Asked via Sending about Luskan and Egg of Galadaeros. Said Arklem took it.
- Disappeared - asked not to be messaged

## Stats
Evocation wizard casting mind blank + mage armor + Crown of Stars (ovechannelled) before any interaction.

He will port to [[irithyll]] if they attack him.
Protective wards:
- Contingency on 1/2 hp => Mislead (invis + illusory double at his loc)
- Contingency on 1/2 hp => Resilient Sphere (dispellable, but draws horde)
- Crown of Stars (7 specks of light orbit head, 4d12 radiant on each)
- Fire Shield/Blur + Mage Armor in morning (18AC disadv with blur)

## Goals
Will want to convince party (right now) that his path is righteous.
Likely, the party will find philosophical holes in his stance, particularly now if he's about to become a lich. TODO: maybe he already has become one? Nah. He's just convinced now by Arklem and Irae.

## Lines BoneCity
WELCOME: (walking up in a black elaborate cloak, with Mirror Image, and flips hood to reveal); "I thought I told you not to try to contact me again. How did you find me?"
EXPLAIN CITY: "After the attack on Luskan, I was left unconcious on the ground, when I awoke some time later, I saw a ritual being performed outside by an elven cleric."
RITUAL: "Thousands raised form the dead, I braced for the worst and held an evocation spell ready to cast, but to my surprise, these undead were not like what I had seen before. They had intelligence. They had memories."
LEADERSHIP: "Before I knew it, I was their savior, they all saw towards me for answers. What could I do? Raise a city of the dead at the sword coast? That would be silly, we would get raided immediately. Kill them all? That would be horrible. These dead are not inhuman monsters, they respond to their names, they talk about their past lives. They might be a little slower than before, but that can be fixed."
VOICE: "That's when I met her, I remember, the sky had a boreal sheen all around it, like this was a protected realm, and in it, an elven woman; Ilharess Alur she called herself; these undead need your aid, they are afraid, they are stressed, they are damaged. We can help you fix them, make them whole again. Bring them with you to BoneCity, and you will be able to complete your lives work; keep the citizens alive; forever."
(NB: This is a high level Modify Memory and mind control that can be alleviated with Greater Restoration, but that is really the first step towards further communication - currently he cannot be persuaded that his work is evil.)

WARNINGS: "Be careful around the city, many things are warded off to the living. (Symbol Investigation 20)"

ARKLEM: "I saw Arklem make his way out with a star for a brief moment of my knock out"
CONFRONTATION: "Look guys. I am almost 50. No kids, all my life I have served the brotherhood. The quality of life in Luskan barely improved as a consequence despite our magical aid. Suffering seemed embedded within the fabric of the world. (orcs, drow, undead, demonlords). There comes a time when a man realizes it's time to commit to a true destiny, one that can actually make a difference to the world, and end the cycle of suffering."

## Lines post-restoration
If they restore him, he will be heavily conflicted with his work. The creatures are indeed still alive, and it's still morally dubious to kill them. But he can be open to a better plan, should one appear. However, if it happens he will have to betray his post and they will be attacked on the way out.

## Lines Pre-Giants
"You want to get to the source of what's outside the city? Go to the source."

"Sure, you can go outside, fight whatever unsightly demon controls the horde outside, and sure, you can die like the rest of our elite fighter squads we've already sent down unsuccessfully with 20 other men."

"We've detected a large amount of conjuration energy emanating from the top and bottom of the giants castle. Such energy can only mean one thing. Large scale interdimensional travel."

"The inner structure of the castle is built on ancient magic. The towering structure, from the hill giants at the base, to the fire giants trawling the depths, and the cloud and storm giants, is one with the weave, and one with the stone. They might be using the structure as a form to channel the weave to cast spells more powerful than what we normally refer to as "9th level"."

"The giants control the castle, and they don't particularly take kindly to intrusion. You can fight your way in, or perhaps you can go undercover."
"Ever seen 3 kobolds stacked on top of each other in a human suit? The principle is the same."
"Alternatively, polymorph, but that would be boring."

WHY HELP? You want to see Arklem? Learn spells reserved for gods? I can help a bit, but he is the Arch-mage.
