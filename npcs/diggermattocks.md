area 14 - p106 in [[blindgenstone]].

## Quests
- Wants to learn about what they’ve seen. Agrees to provide them safe haven, but won’t have Senni give out maps / explain too much without a lot of help. Wants them to help explore uncharted reaches. Aggressive and serious, but also loving husband. Wants city rebuilt.
- Want to figure out why there are so many oozes. Direct them towards the “area”. Spellgem for ooze quest perhaps.
- Wants more space from were rats.

## Lines
- Who sent you? Do’urden? Mizzrym? Baenrae?
- Are you in any way associated with the Drow?

## Status:
Sent them to investigate the Goldwhiskers. Didn't offer them anything except hospitality.

## Senni Diggermattock
Quartermaster, supports husband. Oversees trade efforts to Mithral Hall (dwarven stronghold near spine of the world), Gauntlgrym (fine to mention), Mantol-Derith (darklake black market). She also helps maintain magical infrastructure (Stoneheart quarry + Yantha/Naomi). Knows all the security countermeasures. She probably knows the way out.

She assigns homes to people. Maybe she’ll give them a ghost place, and claim she doesn’t know.

She never got super important to the plot.
