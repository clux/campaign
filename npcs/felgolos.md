# Felgolos
## Encounters
- [[67-felgy]] (initial encounter)
- [[68-goryms-egg]] (freeing felgolos)
- [[69-vault-unseal]] (escape from gilgrin)
- [[73-demo-gone-gone]] (arrived late for demogorgon battle)

## Post-Umnos
left to retrieve the egg (they had enough on their hands), sent a message.
now it's harder for him to send further (found the place, door to shadowfell),
can't return, scoping out the place, trying to send messages every now and then.
he has a divination blocker (a ring casting mindblank?)


### Maybe Future
He needs to be gone for a while. Maybe send a message to the players about `conflicts of divinity, chapter 5`
he sacrificed himself to add a vulnerability to the egg; someone of a particular persuasion have to be raised by Irae and it will corrupt the egg
someone has to turn Felgolos into a god
perditional contradoxy style

or he true polymorphed into a skeleton with a bronze crown and is undercover in velddrinshar.. (although message works across planar boundaries)
captured in polymorphed form (true sight see it), convert him to undead?

or just plain slow conversion to a GHOST DRAGON: CC170.. why?

## Gilgrin Start Place
Rests in the middle of the lava pit, covers large sprawling surface, tail, in the lava / across closed lava acqueduct.

Felgolos: Massive glossy curved wall of metal. The color is kind of a dull red, yellowy.
Tactics: Will just sleep ray everyone in combat. Place isn't big enough for him to fly.

Wants: Freedom now. He voluntarily sacrificed himself to be a guardian of the place, he's engineered many of the setups, and lets giants in, until recently. He has not heard from his eggs in ages, and his lair is now his tomb.

Sacrifice deal: Oversee his offspring and spread them far and wide, and get them into different societies across the continent (5 succeeded, 3 five years ago unknown) He will rest in the cozy lair herein, with access to all knowledge requested, a forge for experimentation (enjoys this)

Eggs: last remaining one transformed ia passage in gilgrin beneath one tower (guarded by fire giants, occasionally an assistant mage (just in it for the money) is coating an egg (in volcanic rock, hardening in lava). Eggs are harnessed for their magical potential and are used as the crystal orbs.
Layout: Small lab in a purple worm lair. Desk. Pulley with diamond tether lowers it into lava periodically when it flashes.

##### Felgolos Intro:
Deep mercer voice. Authoritarian leader type, not very monstery.
Eyes start glowing white, steam starts to flow from them.

"This? This is what you send? WHERE ARE THEY?"
"What have you DONE to them?"

"State. Your business."

appeasing -> steam fades, eyes stop glowing white, and you now see his normal, but still gargantuan reptilian eyes looking at you. small smile forming at mouth?

bailing -> polymorph follow them: "you think i am bound by this chamber?"

"tell me, have you seen my children?" - chult (Baratathlaer), zemnia (Ilnezhara), netherese (Pocyr) - 3 unnamed ones from last batch

History: roamed the world in his 100s, saw the rise and fall of Kiaransalee.
Attended funeral of Akkhan. Knows 3 others disappeared and performed a sacrifice.

"find my children, they should have hatched by now"
"well, neither zoltan nor umnos have not answered my requests as of late" (persuasion)

more tricksy voice in polymorphed humanoid form (faceless one style, yellow robe, white mask) [uses name el-golo]


### Items
Shario's Bracers of Evocation (Boosts Evocation Spells, extra dmg dice to all spells of level > 0)
Ring of Comdemnation (Can cast Comdemn 30ft radius con save vs 8d8 radiant dmg as an action once per day)

Kept here his entire life. Knows a lot of magic, he can help activate magic weapons, if they can smuggle him out with the last egg.
He cannot leave this place unless they destroy the binding magic set up in the library in lower left.

### Forge skills

Can use Annam's Anvil in Gilgrin vault, and can imbue base weapons with fire (for the plus one extra boost up to plus 3), and can polymorph into things. Wants to disguise as a yellow robed wanderer with the faceless white mask.

### Kiaransalee Lore
He is old enough to know about the first rise of Kiaransalee. Knows that she fell in Aruanoch in a mutual clash with Sunwuko and the [[sunset-warriors]] champions Shario + Akkhan + Sunwuko + Natalya 700 years ago. He has Shario's bracers + Akkhan's ring. Some of Sharia's loot is in Halos.

Books tell about societies fallen; in the east to the undead. All communication gone. The whole society corrupted. The empire of the netherese was wiped out due to the corruption of their citizens, not by greedy magicians.

Sunwuko a master monk ruled the City of Shade. They had developed a completely different style of fighting to combat the stun-proof elites of the undead; fast shooting weaponry (auto-reload crossbows).

Tells of the fighting style of Kiaransalee; magically imbued scythe. Could not be charmed, could not be stunned, and could not be transformed in any way. Attacks out of nothing (invis), and when angry.

Kiaransalee lost all her power when the hordes of her followers died in this clash (Helm Rift above the acropolis). Though the last remaining champion, Shario, distributed parts of her relics to various magocracies on the coast. The Eternal Star, a diamond which in its natural form was half a meter in diameter, the pommel of her scythe. The scythe of shadow was taken to Waterdeep.

The scythe is the final part of Kiaransalee's relics in Waterdeep. The handle was in Gilgrin, the pommel in the Luskan. But she still has to use the daemon lords to break Waterdeep to get the scythe.
