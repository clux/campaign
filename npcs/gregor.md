# Gregor
Husband of gemstone lady whose shop went bankrupt in gemstone shortage.
He seems to want to leave his wife (who has kids).

Actually wants to go to BG to sell `sundrop` (drug in [[cooking]]) to finance her shop.
Has an uncle Igor that will look after the kids meanwhile.

Screwed by jewel thieves in [[bregan-daerthe]] that have blamed it on lack of supplies.

## Voice
Normal. He was an improv character.

- [[111-prismatic-pyramid]] Gregor wants to teleport to Baldur's Gate (GW tentatively agrees, but no kids to be brought)
