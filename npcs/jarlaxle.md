# Jarlaxle

Normally resides in the abyss. If she’s here, that means someone has summoned her visage through the underdark somehow. I’d blame the dark elves or some of the other.

Guided the characters to Araj, but never got there.

## Personality
Always calm and graceful! Gambling / foolish seeming facade. Frighteningly intelligent.
Flips a coin / adjusts eye patch when asking questions.

Pre-advice: Seek out the underdark.
Tree/Kundrukar: There might be another tree there, and maybe a passage into the underdark. But you’d have to find it, navigate the vast underdark from an unknown entrypoint.
Warnings: You will stick out looking like that.
Black: “Well, look at me, and look at you. What would you say our most obvious difference is?”

Who are you: You can refer to me as the Sszynrae.

## Questions
What do you know about the fruit? Was that all it grew?

“I will give you some help provided you can do one thing for me.”
“A Drow named Szorryn in Menzoberanzan, has a magical purple amethyst ring. It belongs to me.”
“I tell you advice in good faith that if you do find Szorryn, you deal with him how you please,

## Advice
Seek out Vizeran. Vizeran DeVir. He will have experience. He resides in Araj in the Upperdark.

Will send people to sleep in drow poison crossbow at sign of insolence
NB: gave them a purple ring here to give to Vizeran.
