Led [[pendle]] towards the trials and solas. Lives in [[blindgenstone]].

Alchemist in (area 7/8) & leader of miners guild
Slightly mad. Sells stuff in his place (Zook’s Cromulent Bamboozles)

Happy living a comfy life in his position tinkering away. Cautious of potential rivals.

Will sell them stuff.

## Look
Goggles of Night on him. Fake wig, made out of thin strands of green rope, mullet, blue cape. Old. Leather straps around his armor. Ash covers his face in a star formation.

Rival Base: feels replaceable by new gnome, wants to have monopoly on crafting. Acts friendly at first. Then sets out some challenges to him to see if he’s up to scratch. If he is, he’ll try to sabotage for him and give him broken items.

Action: Wants to see what Pendle makes with items. If it’s good he’ll act unimpressed (obvious). Then give him broken bangs/bombs (every other flash bang, flashes in all directions. Half smoke bomb whiffs.)

If later confronted, he’ll apologize. Try to get him to make them himself and watch him to it.
Again be a bit of a dick. Going through tribulations makes him like you.

Action: Shows him this mechanical snake that he made (Casts Tiny Servant on it)
Knows there’s a better way (Awakene), but that’s not something he can do.

Action: Finding him in tavern he’ll want a drink.  He’ll pull out some challenges:
Medieval Jenga, put on fire from center (if he starts losing).

Good cha: He’ll reveal that there's an even greater tinkerer who lived here a decade ago. (Urifix)

He’s a little crazy gobliny but not too much.
