# Meepo
Friendly red kobold adventurer who helped out the complete Sunless Citadel start adventure in episode 1-3.
High monster voice. Curious, careful. Lucky. Goals; advancement of kobold-kin.

## Development
- Ventured east
- Brought home tattoo tech
- Joined green dragon kobold lair
- Stole some goat stew and got beefy
- [[26-blood-and-beef]] Invited the party over

## Notes
Generally works pretty well with Mordai and Pendle. Hjarka is not super keen on him.


## Second meeting
Riding horses along with two other kobold swolbods.

Rather elaborate twinned metal pike with what looks like a decorative sets of metal pipes almost woven coiling around near the bottom.

Normal shotguns on the other two.
crafted by a famed artificer named Mossburg.

Meepo has 3x kobolds on horseback with him.
He's a Kobold king. CR6 (but only fires shotgun and uses uncanny dodge)
He has magical tattoos giving

Krunk – Kobold Junk Shaman CC 238 (wielding a repurposed candle holder)
Shonk – Kobold Swolbold – CC 240

If they get engaged they'll retreat to their lairs. Maybe a shaman and a swolbold dies, but Meepo must survive. Plot uncanny, plot save, plot evade.

If they engage him they won't get tattoos, but they'll get to clean out wizard's lair.
Goat village wants them to stop their raiding. They kill their prize goats.
