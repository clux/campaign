# Paxos
Patron of [[mordai]].

Patron guides the user into increasingly evil actions?
Patron is a fiend so of course slightly morally dubious.

## Desires
Knowledge. Is one of the higher up wizards in the tower arcane.
Will need time to research book before he can relinquish everything.

## Lines
Bah. I cannot help you if you will not heed my advice. (Kruthik feeding, raiding hell).
There's only so direct I can be with telepathy (Sending)

## Pact of Tome idea
A leathery black book, with the close-up of a tigerâ€™s face embossed into the front.
2 feline eyes follow you as you move the book around.
