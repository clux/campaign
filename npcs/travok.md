### Mechanics
- Travok(5): w/rage: d4 + STR4 + 2(rage) for 3x attacks (bonus frenzy) => 28pr
- 15AC, 55hp. Also has resistance.. So effectively 110.
- Main stats: +7 to hit, adv on STR checks/saves
- Frenzy after stun - he'll de-frenzy.
- Exhaustion: (1) lose adv on STR, disadv. On other saves. (2) speed halved. (3) disadv attack...
- Rogue can't disengage because he has sentinel.
- Travok(4): w/rage: d4 + STR4 + 2(rage) for 2x attacks (bonus frenzy) 18pr
- -7 HP => effectively 96HP
