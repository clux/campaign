# Fracto-Nimbuli
DISEASED Corrupted Storm Giant ruler of [[halos-3]].

Corrupted by Irae via Blackrazor (gift for using the spire).
Divine boon to party if they save him +1 STR up to 20.

## Look
Huge bulging blue muscles with a large golden cumberbud.

Blue light emits from his jaw, eyes, and it crackles from his hair (huge, windswept, crazy, even eyebrows and beard follows this). Shoes up to his knees and as large as a party member. Search for it. Very Zeusy.

Feeblemind?.. can be ended by greater restoration..

Dominate Monster at 9th level lasts up to 8 hours... she is just better at it..

Umnos in non-dominated is a previous champion of Auril, but does not need her anymore, he is as close to his own godhood as is possible.

He is CG normally. Enjoys the worship of all the Giants as Annam's presence has subsided. Wants to be the next Kavaki.
