# Ursula
Grey/blue haired robed clumsy woman with glasses. (abjuration / illusion + lore)

Needs lore of unknown schools of magic found in the world.
Gain ranks by quests.

NB: Has the elusive ring (use damage resistance on reaction).

- Research: Found Shario's blade of shadow is hidden away in the safe of pigerion at the spire of castle waterdeep

Callistis was her great grand mother. Her memoirs mention the burial of Shario, and the sealing of her tomb.

## Post-Irae
Ursula has been scrying worriedly at Neverwinter. Sees events happening. Baphomet near Neverwinter. Yeenoghu has hit Luskan.

Trade routes rough. Gem prices already up 4x after mines cut off. Last shipment from Neverwinter yesterday expected to be the last. Food supplies still okay. Fisheries doing well, trade ships repurposed as fishing vessels.
