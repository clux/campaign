## Meeting
She's stationed at [[nekrina]] handing out cheap contracts to promising fighters/sorcerers from Baldur's Gate to wage Warlock war against the Undead.

## Development
- Met adventurers and sent them on a recon mishion to [[bonecity]] in [[84-chief-bonehead]]
- Uncovered her true nature and forced her to reveal her purpose in [[85-circle-of-zaehesh]]

Still paying the adventurers to assault Bone City, adventurers semi loyal to this cause. Paid well, none are keen on undead regardless, some even swayed by her arguments. Some disagree with the ill intent without provocation though. Only one cleric willing to go through with killing her.

- She will ask Mordai, what is it that you want over anything?
- I can see your carrying around a wizards spell book, even though you are a famous warlock turned sorcerer. Are you trying to become self-sufficient? I can make that happen.

(Sorcerer deal. Technical; Convert him to wizard. Drain sorcerer levels into wizard. Drain warlock levels into wizard. Perhaps leave sorcerer, and hand-wave the source, blessing goes?)
- > Explained; you already know how to cast many of these spells intuitively, all you need is a flash of insight, and understanding to convert that muscle memory into understanding. We can make that happen.
- > What she wants: Help. Use your skills to destroy the undead in bone city. I can provide you with infernal aids at your side in battle, you'll be able to command more powerful helpers than the rest of the warlocks here.
- Justifying battle: Are they going to go peacefully, no of course not. Are you going to see their true side, undoubtedly. There's no way to turn this into a moral dilemma. This anomaly must be corrected before it gets out of hand.

### Purpose
Officially; Hold the line at Nekrinea against the Undead assaulters towards Baldur's Gate.
Unofficially; A place for devils to launch their assault on the undead empire.

### Backstory
`Grenpoli` is her origin city. High rankinding lawyer there.

IDEA1: slightly witty and sarcastic. Understands mortal relations well. Camouflages details very well.
IDEA2: A bit out of it with regards to normal interaction. Legal terms? Although that would expose "my client" and "THE ENTITY".

#### Welcoming lines
So here are the famous adventurers from the north. Pleasure to make your acquintance. I am Zaehesh. I represent powerful interests via Baldur's gate, interests who wishes to defend their perimiters from the undead out east. The adventurers you see here are some of baldur's gate's finest. Additionally, we have also hired this centaur army to fight for us.

WHY ATTACK: Rather than waiting for them to make to many first moves, we w ill do the tactical thing and hit them first, and hit them where it hurts the mosts; (checks notes, sigh) BoneCity (facepalm). An outpost swarming with undead, and known to be empty last year. Thus, likely a hot spot for summoning.

WHY U NEED PARTY: We weren't sure if you were going to make it. But since you are here. We would like your aid. Run a stealth mission around the city. Figure out what's going on. Find weaknesses in their defense and fortifications. Find their numbers, strengths, summoning rate. Then get back to us. This way we know whether or not we are getting into suicide missions or not.

#### Lines for 1
- "There's been a large amount of undead passing through this area"
- "We have been sent her by higher powers through Baldur's Gate to protect its interests"
(Hidden; came from the west, higher powers are infernal)
WHO: "I am not at liberty to divulge the nature of my clients at the moment."
WHY: "The undead are a threat to the continent itself, and the necromancer's horror version of cleric magic (Raise Dead) cannot be allowed to torture dead creatures with this endless suffering. (rob creatures of their afterlives)."
WHERE: Irithil. Vampire City. Also a new city, don't have a name for it, except my notes as "Bone City". Tons of skeletons. Structures also built out of bone.

#### Lines for Mordai
TEMPTATION: Scan mordai with red eyes. Tempt with 2 extra dmg dice on spells < 3th level, for more evocation potency. Or maybe < 4th?
Lines: Never any shame in seeking help.

#### Lines for GW
(He will see her with purple, flickering RED. Canonically evil.)
Oh, great. Who let mister child morality out.
You realize I am from actual HELL right? Are all of us going to be bad?
MAYBE: heaven and hell two side of the same coin schpiel?
We are defeating undead here. Would possible negative could I have for doing that, huh?

SO WHY: As I said, I cannot divulge the nature of my clients at the moment. But that should not distract you from our goal here. Do you want the coast swarming with undead? No? Neither does my clients.

### Offers
Offer `Gate` on conditions to aid the cause (bound to devils). She will have the true name of a fiend dedicated to the cause `Zoroxath the Interruptable` (will only be whispered) what type of demon? Pit Fiend? High end devil. NB: They need to use `Planar Binding` to actually get it to do what they want.

"If you want power, all you have to do is solicit some help from other planes. I can help you accomplish that."

### Shadowfell
Devils don't really have control there. Undead curse keeps things coming back to life there. Things will never have sentience there, but the vampires do have to feed.

### Party avoiding deal
"You think what is happening here is natural? You think just because they are not harming anyone at the moment, that you are making a morally just decision?"
"What do you think will happen when you attempt to strangle the outer realms, by slowly granting immortality to all the inhabitants of the material plane through some magical loophole.."
"You are tampering with systems far greater than you imagine. Sure, perhaps you dismiss the infernals as evil - although with your looks and former choices i find that somewhat difficult to believe - there are still going to be any other plane of afterlife who's disrupted by this."
"Do you think Celestia or Elysium will flurish in an era of a hell destroyed? Having to deal with all the sinners themselves? I think not. They need us as much as we need them. The only difference is that we are honest about it."

Magic: How will society work without warlocks? clerics? paladins? Remaining options are for them not all that appealing. Sure, such a change would be gradual, but over the course of a few generation equivalents, those divine agents will all but disappear.

### Notes
Erinyes give their powers. Devils are not keen on undead takeover. Less souls on the economy, but devils have been a little beauraucratic and only focusing on short-term focused thinking.

NB: Erinyes just look like angels unless they want to reveal their origin. Glowing white eyes. GW Can detect a red shade along her body, but wings glimmer with green.
NB: Erinyes have nno interest in promotion in devil hierarchy (but work under an arch devil), as they can just leave the 9 hells at will. Others must be summoned by a mortal.
Erinyes help create faustian pacts. But now do so at a bargain.
[What They Don't Tell You About Erinyes (Fallen Angels) - D&D](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fNxT_rWvSo)

They are also lawyers in hell. Fiendish codex 2. Grenpoli is erinye city. No violence. Wit + Guile only. No weapons (magic barrier). Most spell fail in city (summoning, damage). Pure politics. Haven to mortal malcontents from 1000 worlds.

TODO: offer the power to understand what the undead are speaking / or something that makes them "seem undead" to avoid all the raising? Maybe sell a potion for it.

NB: She will not willingly give information at the first stage of WHY they are offering these gifts so easily.
Only if they return can they figure out that she is in fact in league with devils.
