# Zaehesh
Erinye emissary from Mephistar from department of long term interests.

![](zaehesh.png) TODO: crop

## Meeting
She's stationed at [[nekrina]] handing out cheap contracts to promising fighters/sorcerers from Baldur's Gate to wage Warlock war against the Undead.

### Purpose
Officially; Hold the line at Nekrinea against the Undead assaulters towards Baldur's Gate.
Unofficially; A place for devils to launch their assault on the undead empire.

### Backstory
`Grenpoli` is her origin city. High rankinding lawyer there.

IDEA1: slightly witty and sarcastic. Understands mortal relations well. Camouflages details very well.
IDEA2: A bit out of it with regards to normal interaction. Legal terms? Although that would expose "my client" and "THE ENTITY".

#### Lines for 1
- "There's been a large amount of undead passing through this area"
- "We have been sent her by higher powers through Baldur's Gate to protect its interests"
(Hidden; came from the west, higher powers are infernal)
WHO: "I am not at liberty to divulge the nature of my clients at the moment."
WHY: "The undead are a threat to the continent itself, and the necromancer's horror version of cleric magic (Raise Dead) cannot be allowed to torture dead creatures with this endless suffering. (rob creatures of their afterlives)."
WHERE: Marsember. Vampire City. New city, don't have a name for it, except my notes as "Bone City". Tons of skeletons. Structures also built out of bone.

TEMPTATION: Scan mordai with red eyes. Tempt with 20% more evocation potency. Or maybe 30%? (Never any shame in seeking help.)

### Offers
Offer `Gate` on conditions to aid the cause. She will have the true name of a fiend dedicated to the cause `Zoroxath the Interruptable` (will only be whispered) what type of demon? Pit Fiend? High end devil.


### Notes
Erinyes give their powers. Devils are not keen on undead takeover. Less souls on the economy, but devils have been a little beauraucratic and only focusing on short-term focused thinking.

NB: Erinyes just look like angels unless they want to reveal their origin. Glowing white eyes. GW Can detect a red shade along her body, but wings glimmer with green.
NB: Erinyes have nno interest in promotion in devil hierarchy (but work under an arch devil), as they can just leave the 9 hells at will. Others must be summoned by a mortal.
Erinyes help create faustian pacts. But now do so at a bargain.

They are also lawyers in hell. Fiendish codex 2. Grenpoli is erinye city. No violence. Wit + Guile only. No weapons (magic barrier). Most spell fail in city (summoning, damage). Pure politics. Haven to mortal malcontents from 1000 worlds.

TODO: offer the power to understand what the undead are speaking / or something that makes them "seem undead" to avoid all the raising? Maybe sell a potion for it.

NB: She will not willingly give information at the first stage of WHY they are offering these gifts so easily.
Only if they return can they figure out that she is in fact in league with devils.
