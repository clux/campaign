## Meeting
She's stationed at [[nekrina]] handing out cheap contracts to promising fighters/sorcerers from Baldur's Gate to wage Warlock war against the Undead.

### Purpose
Officially; Hold the line at Nekrinea against the Undead assaulters towards Baldur's Gate.
Unofficially; A place for devils to launch their assault on the undead empire.

### Backstory
`Grenpoli` is her origin city. High rankinding lawyer there.

IDEA1: slightly witty and sarcastic. Understands mortal relations well. Camouflages details very well.
IDEA2: A bit out of it with regards to normal interaction. Legal terms? Although that would expose "my client" and "THE ENTITY".

#### Welcoming lines
So here are the famous adventurers from the north. Pleasure to make your acquintance. I am Zaehesh. I represent powerful interests via Baldur's gate, interests who wishes to defend their perimiters from the undead out east. The adventurers you see here are some of baldur's gate's finest. Additionally, we have also hired this centaur army to fight for us.

Rather than waiting for them to make to many powerful first moves, we will hit them where it hurts the mosts. BoneCity. An outpost swarming with undead, originally known to contain the famous Vampire TODO:.

We weren't sure if you were going to make it. But since you are here. We would like to request your aid. Run a stealth mission around the city. Figure out what's going on. Find weaknesses in their defense and fortifications. Then get back to us.

#### Lines for 1
- "There's been a large amount of undead passing through this area"
- "We have been sent her by higher powers through Baldur's Gate to protect its interests"
(Hidden; came from the west, higher powers are infernal)
WHO: "I am not at liberty to divulge the nature of my clients at the moment."
WHY: "The undead are a threat to the continent itself, and the necromancer's horror version of cleric magic (Raise Dead) cannot be allowed to torture dead creatures with this endless suffering. (rob creatures of their afterlives)."
WHERE: Irithil. Vampire City. Also a new city, don't have a name for it, except my notes as "Bone City". Tons of skeletons. Structures also built out of bone.

#### Lines for Mordai
TEMPTATION: Scan mordai with red eyes. Tempt with 2 extra dmg dice on spells < 3th level, for more evocation potency. Or maybe < 4th?
Lines: Never any shame in seeking help.

#### Lines for GW
(He will see her with purple, flickering RED. Canonically evil.)
Oh, great. Who let mister child morality out.
You realize I am from actual HELL right? Are all of us going to be bad?
MAYBE: heaven and hell two side of the same coin schpiel?
We are defeating undead here. Would possible negative could I have for doing that, huh?

SO WHY: As I said, I cannot divulge the nature of my clients at the moment. But that should not distract you from our goal here. Do you want the coast swarming with undead? No? Neither does my clients.

### Offers
Offer `Gate` on conditions to aid the cause. She will have the true name of a fiend dedicated to the cause `Zoroxath the Interruptable` (will only be whispered) what type of demon? Pit Fiend? High end devil. NB: They need to use `Planar Binding` to actually get it to do what they want.


### Notes
Erinyes give their powers. Devils are not keen on undead takeover. Less souls on the economy, but devils have been a little beauraucratic and only focusing on short-term focused thinking.

NB: Erinyes just look like angels unless they want to reveal their origin. Glowing white eyes. GW Can detect a red shade along her body, but wings glimmer with green.
NB: Erinyes have nno interest in promotion in devil hierarchy (but work under an arch devil), as they can just leave the 9 hells at will. Others must be summoned by a mortal.
Erinyes help create faustian pacts. But now do so at a bargain.

They are also lawyers in hell. Fiendish codex 2. Grenpoli is erinye city. No violence. Wit + Guile only. No weapons (magic barrier). Most spell fail in city (summoning, damage). Pure politics. Haven to mortal malcontents from 1000 worlds.

TODO: offer the power to understand what the undead are speaking / or something that makes them "seem undead" to avoid all the raising? Maybe sell a potion for it.

NB: She will not willingly give information at the first stage of WHY they are offering these gifts so easily.
Only if they return can they figure out that she is in fact in league with devils.
