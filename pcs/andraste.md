# Andraste
April's new PC

elven horizon walker
backstory:
related to Natalya (ex champion of the realm), acquired one or two of her magic items as inheritance (siblings perhaps got others, or some left elsewhere)

## Silver Helix Faction
She is a high ranking member of `Silver Helix`, an ancient organisation with ties to the `Emerald Enclave`.

"their word faded from the word of mouth as the effects of the sundering, and the fall of the netherese empire came and went, without any accellerating global deterioration, but their leaders still maintain the organisation, operated out of Gulthmere, below the sea of fallen stars".

> faction goal: destroy/distort the information about ancient undead powers, so that history does not repeat itself, and that power structures in the outer planes maintain their balance.
> faction members: high ranking champions of celestials, emmisaries from outer planes (hell, gehanna, ysgard, elysium, limbo), high ranking druids, one seelie court member
> faction stance on undead: heavily anti. lost their most powerful leader and a large part of the eastern land to an undead scourge hundreds of years ago. anything touched by undeath inevitably corrupts.
> faction stance on dragons: heavily in favour of; breeds them, uses them as powerful emissaries, infiltrators of high society to naturally seed trust in them as advisors and allies. the dragons' loyalties to the silver helix will inevitably yield good returns trade, and standing.
> faction recent goal: investigate the death of a blue dragon Chorym in Neverwinter; current insights imply undead influence, but there is also a group of adventurers who were found tampering with his hideout; motivation likely positive, but would like to clear out.
> faction current goal: investigate the corruption of the waters in dragon lake. undead spotted on the outskirts of Cormyr, dispatched by Zaehesh (member)

Membership: High level power. Understanding of planar politics, local political influence.
Leader: `Dhaikhezzish The Incandescent` (sultan of the efreet from plane of fire)
Commander: TODO: ???
Allies:
- TODO: Dragon in Baldur's Gate?
- `Ursula` has met with them in cloak and dagger operations, but it has been about a decade, not been successful in instating
Ex-Allies:
- `Arabeth Raurym` (pre-celerom overwizard of tower arcane, south tower)
- `Felgolos` agreed to influence the giants, but he has not responded back in ages, presumed dead, or not wanting to be found.
Goals: Unity among the planes; natural order to everything, they are a guiding hand towards peaceful coexistence and cooperation. Not above using subterfuge and deception to get a goal accomplished.
Secrecy: Trust likely to be eroded if people knew it was "arguably undermining" public free thought. They are afraid of the mages scrying eyes and as such have magic free zones. Some of them are actively met with. Diana latest from sword coast. Previously Pre-Celerom arch-mage from Arcane Brotherhood.
Tensions: Dhaikhezzish focus on the material planes is not universally welcomed. He has maintained many city-of-brass style ideals of what is reasonable for trade that feels outdated today. He talks a bigger game on unity when not dealing with the city. Due to its size and sphere of influence, it is often ignored.
