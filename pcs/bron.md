## Origin
Artifact emits magic. Said Abjuration.
Artifact is a Drow House insignia, with a command word. Feather fall once per day.


Drow matron mother under Eilistraee (CG drow)
 “Her most common sign was a silvery radiance (sometimes accompanied by a snatch of song or a few echoing notes of a harp)”
Home in Svartalfheim / Svartálfar in Niðavellir AKA Myrkheim. (Ysgard plane).

## Motivation:
Investigation for artifact
Find person who killed his parents / mentee? Whatever he was to him.

Gael investigating:
“I must admit it threw me for a loop. It looked like one of the house insignia of one an elvish house. But see this symbol? (Points to a cursive small d with a slash through it). It does not fit the normal elvish alphabet.”

Jarlaxle investigating:
Sees it’s drow. Recognizes Eilistraee.
