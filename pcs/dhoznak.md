## Backstory
Spent a week in the Feywild, but they disliked him.
Then worked as a smith + 10 years in small temple

### Silvertounged Steve
He was however distracted by the arrival of Silvertonged Steve (so called due to a magical accident early in his life, rather than any particular gift of the gab, giving his tongue a literal shine), a refugee human bard, who arrived at a small temple on the edge of Waterdeep soon after, and formed a close relationship with Dhoznak, leading to them both travelling from the temple on an ultimately successful quest. Dhoznak hung on to his share of the gold, whilst Silvertongued Steve is now living in fear of the many husbands he has offended, and constantly on the move as a result, the money frittered away in inns and travel.

### Ada Rodra
Fell in love with a travelling dwarven peddler, Adal Rodra during temple/smith years.

Shortly after his return to the village (post Steve), Dhoznak was accused of extortion by a rival for the hand of Adal Rodra, after some considerable arguement, Dhoznak was exonerated by the temple court, however his rival, Garrtag Valney, is still bitter over the situation. Dhoznak spent a further few years working at the smithy, and preaching the word of Moradin, but the urge to move on, and work towards something greater has been buiding within him. Rigid and unbending, Dhoznak will either weather the storm or be broken, but will resist to his last!

## Rewards from temple
