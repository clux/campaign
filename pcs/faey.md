## Mithrendain Watchers
done very little here...

## Evermeet
potential hook island (where most sun elves migrated, and sealed themselves off)

## Evereska
Enclosed city atop of a hill between a valley of hills.
Situated between concentric rings of farmlands, and a moat enclosing the white city.

## Level 15 Ascent
From picture of mithrendain top after portal; a staircase. Eventually leading to Seelie Court. But on brige up to that; Spectral Hans standing in the center. Warm but somber smile. Gives you a hug, his energy swirls around you in a constant circle, not dissapating just constantly spinning. You feel it reaching into the very center of your being. As you focus on it, it quickly starts swirling inwards otwards your heart. (Ki restore ability; Focus of Hans)

Trees, gossamer treads, gems, marble columns, irridescent blues, greens and purples. Phosphorescent flowers. Amathysts, Saphires line pathways to throne.

At the top of Mithrendain normally (https://youtu.be/QvFBvIjUlr4?t=445 picture), but it's really a travelling pocket plane moving to where it is needed.

Inside [[seelie-court]]

Faeries abount. Pixies, unicorns all float or dot the parts outside the main platform. Smell of freshly cut grass
Rest of party must wait before bridge.

Titania: Faeynore. It is time, you were granted an audience.
(She's frivolous, brilliant strategist, dry sense of humor, pragmatic, hard to hanger)
I'm not sure it has fully dawned on you. But Hans, is gone. Vanished from the face of your reality if you will.
You have no idea how much he's helped you, but now that all you did for him, was heavily appreciated. For him to rise in the ranks as an Assimar in the Faeywild with such troubles behind him, is nothing short of a miracle.
But we also have to recognise that he is gone. You two would have been a fine team leading the Watchers.
_Anything to say about Hans?_

Titania wants Umnos gone. The place sits as a gateway to Mithrendain and is corrupted by the portal. It's upsetting the balance of this place. The center of Toril weave.

Do this and you will be granted the title of Lord of Shadow and Master of the Watchers. Your name will spread wide. You will have your own section of the faeywild. And you will start to gain the renown needed to help others through your patronage. I could not think of a better elf to ensure the balance is in harmony. While your mastery of the shadows is near unprecedented, try not to succumb to its corruption. I have already lost one sister to darkness.


Faey motivation:
12 monk subclass way of the shadow
will be 3 rogue: assassin
utilitarian
protect the feywild, keep the balance (nature good/evil circle of life)

Bonuses:
- spend ki point to gain advantage
- bonus to wisdom (for his stun dc)
- extract aspects? (cobalt soul - learn dmg vulnerabilities with ki point)
- item? something that gives him shadow blade? 2d8 psychic dmg extra per round?

can do this during the halos battle
hans' spirit helps him find his center; regain 5 ki points as an action once per day
"i did what i had to do, and so must you"
you do not know where this voice comes from, but you find it oddly calming, to see hans' face so calm after all the hardship he's gone through
what happened to him
