# Hanir
## Original backstory
priest of umberlee: "destiny is to become champion of umberlee"
he was convinced
they fell in love
set sail towards island (found coordinates)
entered island found deck together
he failed the test
got angry (confusedly)
went to sleep on boat again
pulled a card
summoned a great powerful beast (kraken)
see wife brutalee murdered by the kraken
he pulls another card
(halved his int - semi retarded)
...
much later
woken up by the umberlee incarnate
becomes guardian of the mirror world of the world
he was there for 100 years
(never passed the test to become a cleric of umberlee)
(lived to see another warrior)

## Tying it in...
ideas:
future Hjarka could uncover something to help out with demon lords
as she's a priestess of umberlee

i.e.
Old Hanir found on the Island interacted with Young(ish) Hjarka
Current Hjarka interacting with Young Hanir
Self-fulfilling prophecy that Hjarka needs to get her back in time.

Hjarka introduces Young hanir to a cleric of Umberlee, to start his journey?

idea2:
Young Hanir fiends priestess, falls in love
Ursula reseaching chronomancy.
