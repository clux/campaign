# Hanir
## Original backstory
priest of umberlee: "destiny is to become champion of umberlee"
he was convinced
they fell in love
set sail towards island (found coordinates)
entered island found deck together
he failed the test
got angry (confusedly)
went to sleep on boat again
pulled a card
summoned a great powerful beast (kraken)
see wife brutalee murdered by the kraken
he pulls another card
(halved his int - semi retarded)
...
much later
woken up by the umberlee incarnate
becomes guardian of the mirror world of the world
he was there for 100 years
(never passed the test to become a cleric of umberlee)
(lived to see another warrior)

## Tying it in Irae
In a battle with her, chronomancy gets out of hand?
To destroy her phylactery, they need to make a sacrifice within?
To destroy her phylactery, they need to reach it in the past?
..maybe it's possible for them to get back, but something goes wrong within?
..no.

## NB BACKSTORY
controlled by a god
controlled by a necromancer
broke free via faey
..still cannot control spells properly
manages to break it somehow
chronomancy renders wild magic unstable

## Tying it in Distress
Hanir distressed with group.
Leaves group? -> research, nervous, selfish?
(he knows he's going back in time, seer confirmed)
he has amnesia? great old one style?
LAY IT ON THICK: chronomancy harms him (his memory)


ultimately, he wants to leave. disrespected gw.
get ursula to request chronomancy
ursula wants to track her, needs example of time magic...
roll wild magic? + take 100+ psychic dmg, unconcious
hanir goes blank? tests on him?
"treat me as a joke", he says in your yellow coat

TODO: ursula can also use this to track her..

goes to hjarka, only party member that cares?

practice seer (divination apprentice), can see signs, somewhat.
misguided, sees signs in different universe. destiny has a certain agenda here.
he falls in love with her?
maybe he learns mind blank.

few strands of sheeps wool as he plane shifts out
(he needs to roll on the table on the high level spell)

TODO: find reasons for fate - if they scrying

## Tying it in...
ideas:
future Hjarka could uncover something to help out with demon lords
as she's a priestess of umberlee

i.e.
Old Hanir found on the Island interacted with Young(ish) Hjarka
Current Hjarka interacting with Young Hanir
Self-fulfilling prophecy that Hjarka needs to get her back in time.

Hjarka introduces Young hanir to a cleric of Umberlee, to start his journey?

idea2:
Young Hanir fiends priestess, falls in love
Ursula reseaching chronomancy.
