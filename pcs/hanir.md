# Hanir

## Future version
Aasimar serving under by a God.
Then controlled by a necromancer.
Faey helped. They worked in Feywild for a while under the watchers

..still cannot control spells properly
manages to control spells after a while.. somehow
but now chronomancy renders wild magic unstable

## Past version
priest of umberlee: "destiny is to become champion of umberlee"
he was convinced
they fell in love
set sail towards island (found coordinates)
entered island found deck together
he failed the test
got angry (confusedly)
went to sleep on boat again
pulled a card
summoned a great powerful beast (kraken)
see wife brutalee murdered by the kraken
he pulls another card
(halved his int - semi retarded)
...
much later
woken up by the umberlee incarnate
becomes guardian of the mirror world of the world
he was there for 100 years
(never passed the test to become a cleric of umberlee)
(lived to see another warrior)

## Tying it in: Distress - Chronomancy
Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ms9lXWCBww

Hanir distressed with group (gw disrespect)
Wants to leave group for research. He's nervous / a bit selfish.
He knows he's going back in time, seer confirmed..
He's also got amnesia. Because Chronomancy harms him and his memory.
LAY IT ON THICK. 98 points of psychic dmg.

get ursula to request chronomancy
ursula wants to track her, needs example of time magic...
roll wild magic? + take 100+ psychic dmg, unconcious
hanir goes blank? tests on him?
"treat me as a joke", he says in your yellow coat

TODO: ursula can also use this to track her..
.. and she can learn from the writings on the page that its existence is a fluke

few strands of sheeps wool as he plane shifts out
(he needs to roll on the table on the high level spell)

TODO: find reasons for fate - if they scrying

## Rejected Ideas

### Practice Seer
practice seer (divination apprentice), can see signs, somewhat.
misguided, sees signs in different universe. destiny has a certain agenda here.
he falls in love with her?
maybe he learns mind blank.
### Unknown Priestess
Young Hanir fiends priestess, falls in love

### Hjarka Tie-in
future Hjarka could uncover something to help out with demon lords
as she's a priestess of umberlee

Old Hanir found on the Island interacted with Young(ish) Hjarka
Current Hjarka interacting with Young Hanir
Self-fulfilling prophecy that Hjarka needs to get her back in time.

Hjarka introduces Young hanir to a cleric of Umberlee, to start his journey?

### Irae Tie-in
In a battle with her, chronomancy gets out of hand?
To destroy her phylactery, they need to make a sacrifice within?
To destroy her phylactery, they need to reach it in the past?
..maybe it's possible for them to get back, but something goes wrong within?
