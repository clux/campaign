# Hjarka
Earth Genasi fighter from [[gracklstugh]].

Found in Chryssalis.
She's possessed by one elemental of her native realm.  Ogremoch.
(Needs to put down elementals.)

Wave is [[hergatha]] (another arachomental – Umberlee's chosen) and she's unleashing the dissonance.
Hjarka's personality is fracturing as a result – what she sees is her dark side personified through Ogremoch/Hergatha.

Umberlee is a red herring. She's not really evil, but people see the dark sides of themselves through her. The blames of peoples actions are often deflected onto her.

Rejected her own concience.

## Wave hooks
Wave was speaking about umberlee.
~~Wave: You've used a lot of my powers already you know? Slarkrethel can restore it on Moray. He's is a priest. His powers are strongest there. Morkoth?~~
Wave is now silent :|
