# Iztlu Satza
**DISEASED** Yuan-ti pureblood GOO warlock searching for Xial in the ocean. Doesn't know who the god is or what he looks like.
So will move on feelings based interaction with something relevant to Xial.

## Development
- [[38-iz-ship]] Iz found and they look for the emperor, sees a shrine to Xial
- [[39-sinking-octopus]] Iz gets to tatalk
- [[43-shipnanigans]] GOO dream
- [[46-neverwinter-redshirt]] Depart ocean, and let Gwyn loose
- [[49-crusher]] Enslaved by aboleth
- Lives months in the shadowfell with Zed, wakes up every day in eggs
- [[50-nowhere]] Is "rescued" by party. Ultimately tries to betray them. Iz slayed.
