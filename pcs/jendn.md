Druid played by Svein while he was over on a 1w holiday in the UK.
He was there for [[grundsgryn]] in episode [[36-grundsgryn]] and [[37-day-of-the-androsphinx]] only.

He somehow wrote his thesis (the origin of thesis) as part of a time travel paradox.

## Future ideas
We discussed a bit of him re-entering at a later point, but for all we know, he's just stationed on Moonshae somewhere.
