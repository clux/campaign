# Mordai
Warlock, only took a few levels in it and hid Chronomancy from patron.
Divine Soul sorcerer after. Blessed by devils in Mephistar.
Wizard. Time to study.

## Developments
- [[03-cursed-grove]] Paxos requests the fruit, but Mordai fails to get/steal it
- [[10-kruthik-dungeon]] Warlock dream 1 (too Fjord-like, failed to do much, mordai pops all the eggs)
- [[80-plutocracy]] Portal to Mephistar and ultimatum

## Patron Paxos
Arcanoloth in the Gehanna


## Level 15 ultimatum
Fiend he's ultimately related to Mephisto(pheles)

Waylain mid teleport. Mephistar. Cania.

infernal: e·tir  tot  zo·ga·ment  a·tle  ho·ha·har
common: child, your presence is required

All info sent in a locked soulbound tome to mordai via an imp with the message.

High level: Contract shit, voiding patron. Reasons: 9 hells and gehanna opposed? Cannot receive more power. Throughput? Data breach issue.

Pit fiend. Azeryx. High Level Relations at Caina.
Eriness. Tryx(ira) Senior Operations at Mephistar.
Annoyed she has to do this.

Look. Your divine claim is important to us. Your contributions in the material plane is valuable to us, you've clearly put a lot of energy into legitimizing your continued claim to the "divine".
But your path is really no longer going to work at high level operations. The fact that a creature on Gehanna can eavesdrop on our divine gifts to you is not acceptable at this level. In fact, at any higher order gifts, would be considered a weave breach. And we take our security very seriously. As does my friend Azeryx over here.

Azeryx (stops hands).
Common: "I am ready to turn your faces into hood ornaments"
Infernal: ath  hant  gu·te  ew  zont  tot  du·zo  hop  mun  e·to·gent

So we are going to need some sacrifices from you. You need to sever your relations to your patron. Which means that active patron gifts will have to stop working. Eldritch invocations will cannot work as it is magic proxied through Gehanna, and that is the security hole we have to close. So eldritch blast, has to go. Find familiar we can migrate to a divine blessing. We have enough imps to spare. Eldritch sight can also be migrated.

However. We realise that this leaves you feeling a little lessened by this contractual revision. So we are prepared to offer you a gracious selection of  divine offerings, at greatly discounted rates.

However, we need one thing of you if you wish to continue your service with us. You need to start a Cult. It doesn't need to be a big thing at first, but you do have to tend to it at least every week, or get someone you trust on it. As a leader of a Cult of Mephistoles, you'll be able to grant signature spells to your fellow cultists; Fire Bolt, burning hands(2nd), flaming sphere (3rd). Which is going to be necessary for you to get enough weave throughput at your higher level adventures.
Goal: Magical skill and power, backed with the will to use it to crush rivals. Find eager recruits willing to study magic. Any monsters that use spells can be convinced to follow, but wizards or other conclaves of sages are also good.

As a result; can keep EB benefits, but it becomes a Mephisto Blast (cold dmg / fire swappable great deal, adding spell casting power (cha modifier) to spell dmg also purchasable). Same dmg.

Bonuses;? wish stones?
