# Pendleblip
Chaotic arcane trickster gnome inventor.
Doesn't want to hurt anyone, but will do really stupid things.

## Devil Deal
Made a deal with the devil in [[16-puzzling-devils]], and had to do a whole set of [[17-infernal-trials]]. His handler is [[vanquesh]], subcontractor for Dispater.

## Vanquesh deal
1. The use of your voice for a day. You must say what is required of you, when the time comes, with an intonation and conviction at your most genuine, and without any form of external signalling to let people know about this deal or any qualms/disagreements you may have with what's being said.

2. The energy of your glory. Should you be part of great conquests, like vanquishing a great evil or saving a kingdom, stories of your participation – no matter how great – will be greatly diminished. You will relinquish the rights to fame for me to leech upon.

3. The souls of your victims.

## Development
Vanquesh used `Pendle's voice for a day` in Waterdeep in [[29-chaotic-pendle]].
He received a scroll to read (arcana*), and infuses him with the power to read it.

> Aracana: low=>conjuration, medium=>portal,high=>modified gate

He needs a resident of this plane to welcome the creature. He himself is just a mirror.

## New handler
[[anjanu]] wanted to amend the contract due to unwillingness of Pendle to carry out soul draining, thus neither get the benefit
