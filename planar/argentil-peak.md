## Combat Design
- Infantry
- Glass cannons
- Brute (low mobility high dmg)
- Artillery (behind infantry, hard to get to)
- Boss (multiple of these)

## Rules
- enemies deal more dmg
- enemies have less HP
- 1 minute turns
- no consumables that do not auto-refresh (lightning staff ok, potions not ok)
- exception: drops found within (keep a handwritten note, divide on find)
- drops must be used within attempt
- resets with unused items: you regain the ones you found before last checkpoint
- short rest auto between big doors
- long rest pods after roughly every other aree (Theatre, Station, Colosseum, Canyon)
- Narrative Initiative; everyone rolls 10d20 at the beginning (note their bonus)

## Intro
You arrive on a teleport circle in a serene, but small fortification, nestled atop, and around a gleaming white mountain.
You are at the top of it, there's path that seems to pass right through it.
Behing you, there's a glimmering wall of force through which you can see below a whole facility on the lower parts of the mountain. 100ft down you see empty battle areas.

## Deprivation Depot
Short entrance hall.
- 2x Androsphinx guarding. AC17 HP100. Both 3xROAR until in combat. Then legendary teleport away.
- 2x Deva. AC17 HP70. Fast fliers. Double dmg, half HP. Glass cannons.

Initial encounter is disadvantageous. If they can punch through then it's easier to fight outside.

Drops:
- Potion of Flying
- Potion of Frost Giant Strength
- Potion of Supreme Healing

## Theatre of Martyrdom
3x Oaken Bolters around edges.

6 Yetis (Infantry, half hp)
2 Abominable Yetis (Brutes, double dmg, only 100 hp)

> Should your moral compass begin to twitch, remember that Yetis are generally regarded as monstrosities and not people.

**Ally**: Gold-Forged Sentinel (Servant of Kavaki); watches for worthy patrons of Kavaki
> This gold plated construct was a donation by a certain lesser deity.
Could either fight for them or bless them. D6 for blessing (Haste one / Heroism all / +2 AC all / Res DMG)

Uphill;
1 Chardalyn Dragons (Boss: Brute/Artillery)
8 Centaurs charging (Infantry / Glass Cannons; half hp double dmg, dangerous charge)

Drops:
- Potion of Heroism
- Potion of Resistance (Radiant)

## Butcher's Base
Long rest save point before jumping down.

500 Kobolds flood in after a line. Swarm. 1000HP swarm.
20 attacks +4 to hit. 1d4+2 dmg dagger.
20 attacks +4 to hit 1d4+2 sling.

> Kobolds are proud descendants of dragons, despite their diminutive nature. They are also instinctive pack animals, and the easiest group to persuade to be part of this test in these numbers. Enjoy.

Put a Gargantuan Rug of Smothering on top of 20ft hill. "Please wipe your feet."
If they don't, it attacks the first who doesn't wipe.
Otherwise, it stays dormant and slides away at the end of combat to reveal a drop:
- Potion of Invulnerability

## Headshot Headquarters
- Huge Stone Golem (Boss; Brutes, slowed movement, double dmg, 150HP, slam can stun DC17 WIS)

> Behold, my Huge Stone Golem! Perhaps not the most imaginatively named of our constructs! But as is so often the case in life, my advice is to aim for the stones.

- 2x Chimeras; Fire breath on recharge. Double DMG/Half HP. Otherwise Drive-by claws. Artillery.

- 3x Unicorns. Modified (healing ranged, but only stays in the back lower area)

> Fun fact: Unicorns are the most common celestial steed. How much this fact is worth is debatable, because most celestial creatures are technically are their own steed.
> Fun fact: Unicorns healing magic originates from their horn.

Drop:
- Potion of Speed
- Scroll; Tasha's Otherworldly Guise

## Decimation Station
- 2x Archmage; (Boss: Artillery/Glass Cannons)
Spell DC17. 9: Meteor Swarm, Blade of Disaster. 8: Abi-Dalzim. 7: FingerDeath, Rev Gravity(c).

## Collosseum of Laceration
1 Archmage (Glass/Infantry: 9 Prismatic Wall, 8c Incendiary Cloud)
1 Iron Golem (Brute/Glass: 150 HP, double DMG - Barbarian Skin? Use Rage Mechanic + Brutal Crit.)
1 Deathpact Angel (Cleric) (Brute/Artillery: Holy Aura - blind attacked when CON save failures, EarthQuake (if not attacked))

End: save point. Maybe bail here if it's boring, or it's getting late. Leave the second half for another time.

LOOT. 1 Wish stone for the Ring of Wishes.

## Arena of Anguish
Kite-fest.

2 x planetars drop down (insect plague if overly kited)
