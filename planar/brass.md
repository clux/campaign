Cradled in a brass hemisphere 40miles across forming a protective shell.
Spectacular place. Lava Brass buildingsrivers.
Huge towers, skyscrapers of artistic brass or rock, big arches and bulbous domes characteristic of ancient arabian architecture, clustertered in one area of the city.
Everything is bright, and covered in a these clouds of steam that rise up out of these reverse fountains. Water is pouring out of these lamp like brass constructions (100ft long), and as the water hits this part of the ground it evaporates.

Floor; brass, but unpaved areas of cracked obsidian, with magma clearly roaming beneath.

Hundreds of thousands living here.

![](efreet-guard.png)

Want to dominate you. Want things from you. Want debts that you will have to repay. Slight them => they will hunt you down.

## Combat
Pyrotechnics.
Creative fire walls.
Melt metal, blowtorch from fingers, heat rays from eyes.
Teleportation.

## Honor Kimzar
Honor is alien to you;
When one of our kind decides to grant one of you a wish, it is our way of amassing honor for our race.

When we grant a human a wish it shows that you desire most, is what we can most freely discard. => Our race have gained honor.
What else would an efreeti need?

Wishing is not a service. Want to have their renown elevated.
Acquiring and trading helps that status.

=> Loosing honor is terrible.
=> Hugely vengeful.

Also they won't see any of this as them being evil.
Will shrug off persuasion attempts.
Unless they succeed, and they will lash out (someone is spreading malicious rumors about them).

## Slavery
Bracelets to show servitute.

Guard: Badass efreeti with hit distributed in such a way that areas on his muscular arm has cooled, creating this solidified basalt rock, in patterns on his arm.
