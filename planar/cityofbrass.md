# City of Brass
Cradled in a brass hemisphere 40miles across forming a protective shell.
Spectacular place. Lava Brass buildingsrivers.
Huge towers, skyscrapers of artistic brass or rock, big arches and bulbous domes characteristic of ancient arabian architecture, clustertered in one area of the city.
Everything is bright, and covered in a these clouds of steam that rise up out of these reverse fountains. Water is pouring out of these lamp like brass constructions (100ft long), and as the water hits this part of the ground it evaporates.

Floor; brass, but unpaved areas of cracked obsidian, with magma clearly roaming beneath.

Hundreds of thousands living here.

## Charcoal Palace
![](brass-chnarcoal.png)

Sultan rules there.
Government. Nobles. Djinni?
Titles everywhere.

## Long Castle
A temenigru like spire.
Where the scrying occurs.

## Heist Palace
![](heist-palace.png)
Lock: Huge metal beam through center. Hand-print on the beam.
Open: Has to be melted with your hand to open. Then reshaded from other side.

## Trade
Gold and precious metals not a worth that much to them. Gaudy.
Wealth of renown, artifacts.

## Gambling
Higher stakes the better.
The cruel the outcomes to a member the better.
They won't let you get away with winning a bet at all.
But they will try to weasel out of any lost bet themselves (looses honor).

## Efreeti
Outside consequences of gods. Bind with elemental forces. Fire + Will.
Avarice, greed, cruelty. Often mistaken for devils. LE.
Burning. Huge 1 TON. Adamantine pantaloons.
Turn into a puff of smoke if killed.
Soul bound conduit of an elemental force.
Ostentatious titles to go with their ego.

Hulking pieces of basaltic rock / metal. Blood is solidified fire. Magma churning through vein. Sustained by heat.
![](efreet.png)
AC17 200HP. Fly 60ft. Body becomes a plume of fire and embers.
High all around stats! Live until they are destroyed by combat.

![](efreet-guard.png)

Want to dominate you. Want things from you. Want debts that you will have to repay. Slight them => they will hunt you down.

## Combat
Pyrotechnics.
Creative fire walls.
Melt metal, blowtorch from fingers, heat rays from eyes.
Teleportation.

## Honor Kimzar
Honor is alien to you. (NO it's just a flex.)
When one of our kind decides to grant one of you a wish, it is our way of amassing honor for our race.

When we grant a human a wish it shows that you desire most, is what we can most freely discard. => Our race have gained honor.
What else would an efreeti need?

Wishing is not a service. Want to have their renown elevated.
Acquiring and trading helps that status.

=> Loosing honor is terrible.
=> Hugely vengeful.

Also they won't see any of this as them being evil.
Will shrug off persuasion attempts.
Unless they succeed, and they will lash out (someone is spreading malicious rumors about them).

## Slavery
Bracelets to show servitute.

Guard: Badass efreeti with hit distributed in such a way that areas on his muscular arm has cooled, creating this solidified basalt rock, in patterns on his arm.
