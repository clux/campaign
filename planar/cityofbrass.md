# City of Brass
Cradled in a brass hemisphere 40miles across forming a protective shell.
Spectacular place. Lava Brass buildingsrivers.
Huge towers, skyscrapers of artistic brass or rock, big arches and bulbous domes characteristic of ancient arabian architecture, clustertered in one area of the city.
Everything is bright, and covered in a these clouds of steam that rise up out of these reverse fountains. Water is pouring out of these lamp like brass constructions (100ft long), and as the water hits this part of the ground it evaporates.

Floor; brass, but unpaved areas of cracked obsidian, with magma clearly roaming beneath.

Millions living here.
efreet but also salamanders, archons, genasi, fire giants, elementals. 2/3rd slaves.

Curfew every night, the illuminated come out with gongs and bells to signal.
(First offence is arrest and fine, second loss of hand, third is death)

When city hovers, there is oil in the canals (which are occasionally lit).

### After Rak
Ticketing office, several tickets on the ground. Several elite guards around during payout, big money. Line outside the checkout line, but not very big this time, not many had bet on you.

As you step forward in the line, the efreet 4m in front of you completes and one elite guard waves you forward (there are several).
RP
Financiers, spend extra time going over certificate to double check.
- You put 50k against Rak Tulkhesh? You are either the luckiest motherfuckers in the plane.
(Dont want to be fired over this, nonon, the gold is there, I even messaged the Obsidian).

The efreeti, who was interviewing you earlier comes over. Shouting insults!
 - frogs, fucking frogs? there are outright lies, i demand that these creatures be jailed!
eventually, several elite guard  in; so let me get this straight, you are meant to run extensive background checks on the contestants, and you use their own input as a significant determiner in their odds?

## Combat
Pyrotechnics.
Creative fire walls.
Melt metal, blowtorch from fingers, heat rays from eyes.
Teleportation.

## Honor Kimzar
Honor is alien to you. (NO it's just a flex.)
When one of our kind decides to grant one of you a wish, it is our way of amassing honor for our race.

When we grant a human a wish it shows that you desire most, is what we can most freely discard. => Our race have gained honor.
What else would an efreeti need?

Wishing is not a service. Want to have their renown elevated.
Acquiring and trading helps that status.

=> Loosing honor is terrible.
=> Hugely vengeful.

Also they won't see any of this as them being evil.
Will shrug off persuasion attempts.
Unless they succeed, and they will lash out (someone is spreading malicious rumors about them).
