# Penthacoron
A folded pyramid (looks like a 5-cell / hypertetrahedron projection) mechanism that unfolds into a demi-plane where Queen Neri / new player has been imprisoned within (9th level hedged prison - imprisonment) - labyrinth.

Goblim realm of money loot goblins.

## Developments
Pentachoron identified as a planar teleporter.
Goblin came out of it earlier trying to move it. But he escaped into it.
We think it contains a rather large plane, demi-plane, pocket-plane hard to tell.

## Underlying Mechanic
Tetrahedral interconnection. Each face is a tetrahedron that has a path to every other. 10 triangular walls â€“ everyone maps to another. Solve every room and unlock the center room.
