# Tesseract
A dimensionally-stable cubic prism (looks like an 8-cell / tetracube projection) mechanism that unfolds into a demi-plane

![looks](8-cell.gif)

Contains an ashen wasteland with a pyramid as its center piece, which contain [[arklem]]'s phylactery.

## Lost Pyramid
Slave knight like wastelind like ashes of ariandel.
Gael; Slave knight guard within + mummies?.

Inside the pyramid behind several locked doors.
Some arcane locks that require through manipulation (Arcana 20) / Knock.

Within, vase with green glowing essence within. Smash it / holy water it to weaken and render lich vulnerable. He will appear at that point with backup.

### Phylactery
Glowing silvery pyramidal gemstone (d4).
If someone smashes it while Arklem is around, he will insta Power Word Kill before trying to get out.

## Ideas
Mummies roam the tomb. Mummy lord and Iron Golems in final room.
If inner doors is breached, one of many permanent alarms are triggered.
Then they get to fight both Arklem and a mummy lord.
Revamped tomb of horrors? That one young youtuber had a revamp idea of it.
