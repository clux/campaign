# Tesseract
A dimensionally-stable cubic prism (looks like an 8-cell / tetracube projection) mechanism that unfolds into a demi-plane

![looks](8-cell.gif)

Contains an ashen wasteland with a pyramid as its center piece, which contain [[arklem]]'s phylactery.

## Wastelands
Ringed city like wastelands with Gael.
Portal outside the city. They have to walk through the wastelands.

Every time someone enters a Nightwalker summons and draws towards them at a rate of 15ft until within sight range, then it finger of dooms them (300ft range).

## Prismatic Pyramid
Actually looks like a fucking vegas pyramid. Lit like a it's a just a searingly white glow block, but upon closer inspection, the light is pulsing, and shifting, as it's lit by multicolored light in all levels of the rainbow. You catch on between cycles that the outermost light provides a blue glow.

![](tesseract-dungeon.jpg)
Step up to it. See something sticking up under the sand. Leather welcome mat.

Traps: cold + electricity + polymorph (immune for lich)
Mirage Arcane?
Other: gas filled room with a zombie who lights a match
Black Fire: wall of greenish/black fire; 4d6 COLD dmg to cross

Permanent spells are the least of its defences. Protection from good, Detect Magic and detect Invisibility, unseen Servant, to name a few. Inner sanctum surrounded by a permanent Prismatic sphere spell. Possibly forbiddance.

Inside the pyramid behind several locked doors.
Arcane locks that require through manipulation (Arcana 20) / Knock.


- 2x Eidolon MTF194 CR12 temple protectors

Telegraph some traps:


- Skeletal archer statues. All firing at same time when crossing something..

### Phylactery
Protected by a ~~5th Element style puzzle~~ permanent Prismatic Sphere around the vase in the center.

Within, vase with green glowing essence within. Smash it / holy water it to weaken and render lich vulnerable. He will appear at that point with backup.

If someone smashes:
- it triggers the destruction of the pocket plane, they have to get out (skill challenge)
- while Arklem is around; he will insta Power Word Kill before trying to get out


### 1. Red room - Wrath
Room filled with fire. 2d6 fire damage every round.
White Irae standing there, dodges all ranged attacks / spells
They can:
- freeze themselves
- freeze the room
- forgive her / cold hug

### 2. Orange room - Gluttony
Right next to it. Acid.
Rancid meats everywhere.
You have to eat a lot, succeed on con save (GW auto), and fart to win.
Skeletal corpse here (goliath); carved on the wall; FOOD NOT GREAT.
CON save fail => poisoned

### 3. Yellow Room - Greed
Bottom next to it. Lightning.
Beaten by Force.

1 diamond in a room connecting with chain lightning, but hovering over a chasm in the ground.
Clearly a source of power for the crackling electricity in this room.
Sitting on a pedestal in the room. They have to crush it with force.
- One energy sword (mordenkainen sword) hovering in the air around it

If they take it out of the chamber, diamond shatters; 10d8 force damage. (Loss)
- Eldritch blast / Banishing Smite / Magic Missle / Bigby's Hand works
- Cutting the diamond on the sword works

### 4. Green room; NPC: Gorgon Greaser (right top) Envy
Netherese Construct Artificer: Armorer. 8ft tall mithril golem. Verdelite gauntlets.
Green gas exhaust extrudes from a slit in its face. Two perfectly horizontal slits in his face glow with a faint green light.
Does not speak, but can write. (Doty).
If attacked, he will grappling hook (instead of move), lightning punch the instigator into the ground.
If grappling hook, can reaction extra attack it.
Two attacks per turn normally.
2d8 poison damage per hit. Bonus action regain 15 temp hp.
Fixing mechanical Gorgons in right room. Mini workshop.

He can undo Green layer with Passwall spell.
He is amenable to persuasion via Envy. He wants something green.


### 5. (Light) Blue Room Sloth
Huge ass snowball trumpelling down the corridor? Fire challenge; need to actually fire them through the ice?
Maybe just a glacial room that they need to perforate?

### 6. Indigo (blueish purple) Lust
Restraint. Movement speed halved. Dark. Beaten by daylight
Undead Sunwuko? He will stunning strike you. Beaten by turn undead.

### 7. Violet Pride
Blind when going inside. But can find loot here:
- potion of invulnerability (can be used to insanity pass the sphere // combat) lasts 1hr.

blindness; pride puzzle?
if no time, just limit to Mordai... If he kills her, he gets the potion. If he walks to far around, he notices the illusion.

ALL START WITH DARKNESS. They are actually blind. They cannot touch anything. Taking the thing they want, makes them feel good. But "don't know what effect this has".

Mordai: Small room full of books, you feel older. In your hand you hold a fading scroll with chronomancy runes. Most natural thing in the world, you know how to do this. In the room; history of Waterdeep, childrens tales, you've not seen these in decades. There's a small crash of a glass from another room, as the familiar smell of fresh apple cider streams from the room. Woman; standing over a small purple skinned child. If you are going to be accepted into society you cannot go on breaking things. You instinctively find yourself uttering the words "Sorry mum". The kid leaves. She turns around. Sees you. Smiles and sighs. "I guess I always knew you had something like this in you.". "I knew you'd turn out to be important in this world."


If he fails, all(nails spell, hugs her, shares a story) he is petrified. Maybe Persuasion rolls to do it? Good = bad for him. "World moves slowly in this place"


GW: Extreme Kavaki Temple. In front, status of GW. Wings out. Spectral dwarves. Chanting Kavaki + GWs name. Did he imagine
Faey: Titania sneaks up on. Darkness. Then suddenly a of purple light.  Faey to become a permanent member of the Seelie Court.
MAYBE stepping in coins, about 500 on the floor. 4 big chests, one pillar in the center
maybe pillar disappears if taking gold?


## Ideas
Mummies roam the tomb. Mummy lord and Iron Golems in final room.
If inner doors is breached, one of many permanent alarms are triggered.
Then they get to fight both Arklem and a mummy lord.
~~Revamped tomb of horrors? That one young youtuber had a revamp idea of it.~~ Hard.. Not enough time.

### Top Right Pillar
Swarm of Gorgon CR5 MM171 (5x bulls) charges towards them from both ends if touched
