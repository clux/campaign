Filled with creatures worshipping Kavaki from any time. Many goliaths.
Also any creatures that can do planar travel and want to fight.
Goliaths here have really perfected their fighting style.

Great battle

Who would prank that.. Faey creatures!

Owlbear. Goliaths.
Giants (Annam)
Dragons (ancient, planar travellers).
Empyreans.
Rocs, yetis, purple worms sometimes.

# Welcoming party
Goliath lady (died of alcohol poisoning after the "just good fun episode").

# Lesser Deity Kavaki

A large spectral goliath is there, two large horns curling half a rotation around the side of his head, but somehow, he ends up looking less like a fiend, but rather more cute. You don't know him, but he looks at you with a big smile.
Kavaki is a ascended Barbarian (Grog style). 8 INT.

## Portfolio
Living simply. We strive to live an authentic life. A life in tune with our values, so that we can act on our instincts and know that we did all we could.

Used to have "Competition + fair play + survival of the fittest."
But he's had to reduce his reach in recent years, since it clashed too much with the portfolio of Annam.

Well, keep selling this. Maybe with a little more marketing. So people will understand it.

"Kavaki"
"Simple. Authentic. Kavaki."

## Intro for Faey
Titania offering ability to become invisible even when in brightly lit areas.
Once per long rest, Greater Invis.

## Intro for Mordai
Well, I don't usually do infernals. The whole evil thing and all. You don't look that evil though. Goatweaver, is he evil?

Well, I can give you the blessings if you spread the word.
Cast Stoneskin once per day.

(can help him tap into the weave through him, warlock patron replacement)
has to change to http://dnd5e.wikidot.com/warlock:celestial
reskin eldritch blast (kavaki bop)
(or selune could help him intuit sorcery and funnel it through ysgard)

## Intro for GW
Wearing big green vestments that are too big for him (not closing properly).
Uh. Hi. I don't usually do this. But you've been really good.
(he has to do this so he can maintain godhood, otherwise fades into obscurity)

oh, (excited) dressed for the occasion, wouldn't want to be sending the wrong message, with the ol' sight and all.

Welcome to your arisening. I have.. you have been doing real well, uh, i mean, you've been mauling things really hard lately. (oh, this sounded so much better earlier).

Well, you see. I am really a very strong, and good god. I don't even have to try very hard, that's how good I am. I was the strongest Goliath in goat master tribe of redwater. I smashed things so hard, they called me the ram. No one else smashed as hard. Even when I was far away, I heard them calling my name. It made me even stronger.
(One of the next leaders actually went on to save the world, and it was the best thing. He gave me soo much credit, and since then I've been able to pick and choose my favourite goliaths ever since. Akkhan.)
(Now they call me their creator, just because I helped the tribe when I was younger.)

Anyway. And you have reached a critical threashold of paladineosis/paladiniusness you've become a real palagorn, and as much must retrieve your reward.
To my most devout goatlings, (with the best name, i knew from birth that you were going to be special, i had already chosen).

But it time. You have proven yourself worthy of my powers. I will grant you a portion of my powers. But in return, you must save the world, and spread the good word of me, Kavaki. So that the legacy can live on. Also, I still need followers so I can stay here.

Bonus; damage dice increase on axe/mauls. 2d8 now.
(Invincibility as a level 20 boon - once per long rest thing).

### Lines
"I am going to need some dramatic effect for this transformation. These humans do not know she's a weretiger yet."
"Oh, hey! Hello! Welcome to my secret lab. Secret lair? Moon Pavilion? Yes, I like that one the best."
"Uh, you're from the prime material. You smell oddly. Who let you in here?"
"Kavaki? hurgph, that brute."
"ooh, wait someone is getting married. he's a follower so he needs a wedding night blessing."

"Sometimes I put my hand on the shoulder of the nearest passer-by -- which for the record aggravates my vomit reflex -- and I say Good job! Lord Garflax of the Tardik system values your sacrifice, to mess with them! And then I burn an effigy to Lord Garflax."


# Greater Deity Annam the all father

## Recap Ysgard1
Old goliath lady guids you two Kavaki. A simple god with a simple mesage. He talks about his simplified portfolio, and offers a simple warlock domain to Mordai.

He gives GW kavaki true sight. Titania conspires with Kavaki to also let him travel through plants.

Infinite staircase to Selune. Also accessible at top of Mount Waterdeep by the Griffie Eyrie. She had a bit of a mad scientist feel to her. And was mentioning that she needed test subjects for her "Argentil Peak" gauntlet.

You saved the last dragon egg from destruction. The spine powered down, and giants are once more under a cloudocracy; this time without storm giants.

Goatweaver collects a bunch of armor components from the frost dragon. Felgolos could do some more enchantments later.
