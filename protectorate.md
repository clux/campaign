# Cloud Giant Protectorate
At the peak of mountain (seemingly). Above the teleport spiral in its own dome. 
Layer of sky visible beneath the frost RIM. 
Directly above the dome is an independence day style sylinder ion cannon above. 

The final spire (Halos) lies above. It's reachable through flight in there, OR via two spiralling-non-echerian bridges upwards into the sky. 

Protectorate locked out Suri comes to help at this point (they must've destroyed the orb in rimehaze) 

## Sociology
The Protectorate is governed by Halos (and fracto nimbuli), but they in turn have autonomy to oversee operations of giants. (No undue taxation unless necessary. Mining setups, weapon delivery, conflict resolution.) Peaceful race in general if unprovoked, but won't stand for injustice. 

Lawful good nature makes them the most fit to oversee the sociological aspects of giantkin. 

Storm giants are Chaotic Neutral, but still understand the benefit of an underclass and thus grants the protectorate general autonomy.. 

Sansuri works for them, and frequently visits the Boreal Valley (where her husband the Jarl resides). 

Safe if they mention Suri. She is technically their ruler – but had been away on diplomatic mission to frost giants in Boreal Valley. Protectorate knows about the corruption and willing to take help from anyone who is resistant to it.

## Knowledge
They have a library of lore and information on how to tackle Halos. 
Also speak of the Hammer of Thunderbolts deep within Gilgrin (reluctantly) 
Have the key to let them in, but they still have to sneak. 

Know about the dragon Frygt that the storm giants use for defense. It eats whatever. Has a floating island orbiting Halos. Tons of loot there. Ancient. 

Know about the mind control magic used. Lore says it's a form of mind control domination similar in strength to that of an Aboleth.

Know that the demon lords now are starting to set course for major cities. Yenaghu for Luskan. (UPDATE: Luskan under attack).

Baphomet for NWN. Orcus for WD (but he failed in the ocean).

Knowns about Umnos who most history books refer to as Fracto-Nimbuili because of his ability to split the sky open.

Knows that dragons are a big part of their culture. Storm Giants used to ride blue dragons, Rimehaze still breed frost giants (have 2 young ones below), and Gilgrin used to harness the power of one, but no longer as far as I know. (Used to have a red dragon called Golgoroth) - but think it was traded away to a larger dwarven city.

## Design 
Dome – 600ft diameter 

4 big quadrants for each ministry. Center annulus for access between them. Elevator in centre goes to rimehaze only. Does not work further up (needs powers, control room was locked up in rimehaze). 

Each quadrant has stacks of bookshelves of information. 
 

one about the cult of the shade maidens, their split from lolth, and the following of an undead necromancer going by 3 names; Lady of the Dead, the Revenancer, The Vengeful Banshee -  

one about demonic summoning and their limitations (talk to gludom about it: even their aspects are weaker than their original form, they were still summoned by >9th level magic, so they will be close to their potential:  if the summoning gate were to be closed, then it should be possible to weaken their magical powers with a certain ritual (need ingredients, hearts of the people in charge, tongue of a purple worm, and I supposed a really big bone (necessary to hold it together)). 

## Key Figures
There are about 6 cloud giant guards along the entrance. 

4 elite cloud giants (base looks like the OOTA Librariants in Gravenhollow): 

### Doksag ; Minister of Commerce
Deals with monetary policies with dwarfs for iron ingots. Micro for giants.
Has dogs. Ridiculously high int: 20 (base 18 + ioun stone +2 int – marbled scarlet blue spheres orbit) 

Can cast: scrying, modify memory, mislead (invis self -> double visible) (contingent on new people in protectorate), contingency, freezing sphere, chain lightning,  ice storm 

### Ailos ; Minister of Health
Druid (jolly, slow talking hippy, older) 

Can cast: 
reincarnate (5th druid) fallen – race change 

Sleet storm, wind wall, dispel, hold person, moonbeam, find traps, polymorph, greater restoration 

Understands that the domination magic is the same as what aboleths used. The drow used to study them.

### Gludom ; Minister of Wizardly (science/energy)
Faster talking, wants to revolutionise the energy production of the protectorate to have lights and weather control – he ultimately designed the spine. Apologetic, but not unreasonably so. Concerned with the unauthorised use of it. Worried the humans are sent to judge him for its use. Nervous.

He offered them rest below, and the key.
Tell them about:
- their last emmisary `Sifthor` (never returned from Halos)
- Hammer in Gilgrin

### Arfius: Minister of defence
In charge of frost/iron giant military parties, and hill giants by proxy, but they're a little hard to control).

Conversation: about mind control below "most concerning". Umnos has thankfully not issued us any orders, perhaps  

 
### Setup for EP50
Tell them about last emmisary (Sifthor via Gludom)
Tell them history of construction (Arfius)
Tell them about corruption type (Ailos)

Tell them how to get to Vault in Gilgrin.
There is portal straight in there from Rimehaze, from the citadels construction 1000 years ago. But 200 years ago, to ensure this was not abused it was sealed away. Two keys were made. One for Umnos himself, one locked away in a sealed chamber, protected by a construct that ensures the key never leaves the chamber. It was made by Umnos himself. Rumor has it that he kept a backdoor to get in, but it was never found. The magic is too powerful to dispel because it is powered by the spine of the world.

Alternative way; take the elevator down
Alternative 2; drink fire resist potions.
 
### Development
Luskan scried upon. Tower still standing, but looks like it's taken a heavy beating. Gnoll corpses everywhere.

### Felgy Interaction
saw the destroyed eggs
investigate
Gludom (min wiz) ultimately sent for a mage to help construct the spine
so he knows about the eggs => he knows about felgy
=> apologetic, points to other children (Baratathlaer in CHult, Ilnezhara in Zemnia, Pocyr)
=> felgy resentful, does not know the structure they've set up
"did they not tell you of the wailing banshee growing up?"


 
TODO: reveal small hints of irae along the way so they are better at fighting her further up 

Cloud giants will have info + archives. 

Will point them towards the reliquary (heist in storm giants) + gilgrin 

Learn lore of her deadly spell combos somehow.. 

Dead giant that is an early clue of how it died. 

Hjarka mind control showcase? 

Irae displacer cat (displacement illusion disadv to hit, half damage saving throw vs all dmg)
