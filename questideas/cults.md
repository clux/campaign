## Stranger than Fiction IV: What Even Are Cults
https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/jyczho/stranger_than_fiction_iv_what_even_are_cults/

The five **characteristics** are: _godlike leader(s)_, _flexible beliefs_, _reinvention of the self_, _isolation of believers_, and _elite membership_.

- **leader** - ranging from prophets, literal manifestations - infallible + essential. in face of setbacks / self-contradictions, they must show it was part of their vision (couldn't reveal until they were ready). Allowed misfortune to test their followers. Never wrong. Key to reaching the goals of the organisation.

> Q; do they do this **cynically**, fully aware of what they are doing and manipulating it, **or** do they **believe in it themselves**? What myth or legend has made their **charisma**? In the world of D&D, what powers towards deification can they actually gain or use for the purpose? **How** much does the cult **serve** only the leader, and if a lot how is this justified?

- **flexibility** - secret of the world / humanities place in it. changeable, but cultists won't see the dissidence. The purpose at the end is the most important thing.

  > Q: what is the core, unchangeable belief at the center of the cult? What actions can they take to get there? Why is it persuasive, what does it offer them? How can it adapt whenever proven wrong? What is the leader's role in redefining the cult's beliefs? Can it survive without the leader?

- **reinvention** - asked of all people. Skin in the game. Causes a tight-knit community. Different from team-building in that it has to be powered by a belief that it's happening for a reason, and they are becoming a more advanced type of person for having gone through it.

> Q: what are the rituals they use to reinvent themselves? What are they trying to attain? How do senior members initiate the new ones? Are there additional levels of reinvention beyond the first? What does a reinvented cultist look like or act like? Should they literally gain some powers?

- **isolation** - beliefs/reinvention can only work through isolation from the rest of the world. Could sequester away or take extreme villainous measures to keep the world away even as they live within it.

> Q: How does the cult keep information from outside from getting in? What are the punishments for letting information in? How do they interact with the world when they must be out in it? How does the cult isolate people from their friends and family?

- **elite** - not just for the gullible. appeal to particularly smart / capable people because they appear to be a special group not everyone can be a part of. requirements prevent entry for some, makes other feel as part of an elite group. This feeling reinforces the previous characteristics. Complimentary to the feeling that they will get elite rewards for their sacrifice.

> Q: why do cultists see themselves as unique and special when they are part of this organization? What prerequisites are there to membership? What do they have to do to prove that they deserve membership? How are various levels distinguished from each other within the cult? What do they gain, what secret knowledge is dispensed with membership, what boon is granted?

### Heaven's Gate
Suicide cult in 1997. Haley's comet tail == alien ship hiding. Suicide to beam them up.

**Leader**. `Marshall Applewhite` + `Bonnie Nettles`. Mixed sci-fi, bible, occult into a Christian God who was real, and alien. Read into Book of Revelations, and made alien spin. Leaders claimed they were gods. Jesus/God were incorporeal and could take over bodies.
**Flexibility**. Recruited widely, avoided anyone who might recongize them. One leader died of cancer, so a God died? No they changed their beliefs. She clearly couldn't die, so only her vessel died.
**Reinvention** Everyone asked to chaing themselves to attain the next evolutionary level; rid themselves of pitiful human traits (gender, personality, possessions, etc), then when time comes, they would be taken by aliens to ascend. Required to reinvent themselves to get the reward at the end.
**Isolation** Obvious from ^. Nomadic people to follow leaders, gave away everything. Became more and more reclusive later. Rented a compound for everyone, shut out from the outside world.
**Elites** Ascetic life not easy, had to prove themselves. People expected to fail.

>  attracted smart, capable people because it told them sure you’re smart and capable, but that’s just the start.
> People like feeling not just smart, but like they are holders of secret knowledge. There’s something about knowing the world’s secrets better than the common man that is enticing and seductive. A cult plays into this by giving that feeling to them; more importantly, it makes them work for it. A religion puts its beliefs up front (generally) for people to see, but a cult gates that knowledge off and releases it slowly to believers to make them feel special, different, chosen.

=> Membership not illogical. Preys on psychological exploints. Faceless cultists are faceless by choice, not because you need a villainous mob, but because they gave them up in service of a greater power that knows they are special, gives them secret knowledge, and treats them like an elite + chosen group, who deserves the rewards at the end.

### Aleph
aka `Aum Shinrikyo` aka. `Aum`. Responsible for 1995 Tokyo sarin gas attack. Ex-yoga study group.

**Leader**. `Shoko Ashara`. Spiritual guru preaching a more pure and original Buddhism, refering to Buddha's secret teachings. Stole some bits of Christinity, claiming he alone could take on the sins of the world to redeem people. Claimed to be Christ in 1992. Sold his own bathwater. Made a brainwave device to transmit Ashara's thoughts and personhood into people. Executed in 2018.
**Flexibility**. Predicted various doomsdays, recalculated when they didn't happen, leader execution hasn't killed the cult. Rituals and foundation of community == real power of the group. Beliefs change to fit uneditable facts.
**Reinvention**. Give all belongings to the cult, give up their lives to join. Goal is to literally clone the leader (through indoctrination + brainwashing + brainwave devices). By becoming Ashara they reach the secrets of Buddha which Ashara 'knew'.
**Elites**. Ashara argued the world was going to end (nuclear winter / ww3). With faith in Ashara believers could be saved, and with enough believers, the fate of the world reversed. Makes people feel special when everyone is normally in this cutthroat capitalist 60+ hour workweek Japan.

> Karma is not direct, it’s a universal system of waves that we are creating, reverberating throughout infinite time and reincarnations. Everyone is connected, every event is just the waves of karma shifting our fate and balancing the karmic debt from thousands of lifetimes of ripples.
> believed: their devoted group could change the world through the power of their karma. By following their leader, living lives of good karma, and serving this one shining light that promised to fix the infinite pattern controlling all fate, they could suck away all the bad in the world and prevent these karmic waves from destroying everything.

**Isolation**. Cults can overcome doubts when beliefs are reinvented, making people believe they are elite and unique, and by isolating members from outside influences; a self-reinforcing bubble (screening out contradicting info). But isolation was also to protect them.

> these people saw themselves as the last hope for mankind, the calm center of the storm trying to spread that calmness against the encroaching waves. Part of what made them a cohesive community and made them commit was because they thought the world would push back on them. They had to fight against bad karma. And remember, karma is not individual, it is a universal pattern that links every person together, not a direct action/reaction dyad. The people that resisted Aleph did so as part of this universal system of bad karma shaking the pattern. Aleph’s little pocket of good was under attack by the system, almost like Agents taking over individuals in the Matrix. And Aleph was under attack. They were sued for fraud and kidnapping by parents whose kids joined the cult and faced numerous legal battles about all sorts of other, very legitimate, complaints of illegality.

> violence: So how does a yoga, self-help group become terrorists with biological weapons? Because they saw themselves as an isolated bastion trying to save the system from itself, they viewed their attackers not as people but as expressions of that system, and because the fate of the universe hung on them and them alone. It might have seemed like just some lawsuits to outsiders and the resulting attacks as absolutely inordinate retaliation, but on the inside this was a defensive war for the future of the world.

=> easy to quickly grow violent, won't be seen as retribution/violence, but rather necessary evil in defense against those already attacking us.

### Mao Zedong
Started small. The Cultural Revolution was as much an attempt to recapture the magic of his first cult, as it was a totally new expression of his cult.
Interestingly not divine, yet still the most deified of them all.
> Charisma + mythical heroism in a leader can make the cult feel special and an embattled minority, even when it's the clear, dominant, oppressive majority.

**Flexibility**. Every believer replaceable. `Peng Dehuai` who worked with him for years, was later publicly ridiculed, accused of being deep-capitalist plant, and had his history purged, after he posted a letter slightly criticising the Great Leap Forward (which caused a huge famine). Ditto for `Liu Shaoqi`, despite 20 years of service. Everything he did was later portrayed as a great deception and betrayal of Mao.
**Reinvention**. Rectification process. Read Mao/other approved tests, commented, and criticized themselves in front of smaller groups. Repeat until it felt sufficiently sincere. The resulting movement went on to rule China for 40 years. Mao decided the first 20 made them soft => Cultural Revolution to replace the group. Similar blueprint of criticizing. Reinvention of the self a proxy for reinvention (revolution) of China. Members formed party. Saw rectification as a prerequisite to save country from imperialism. Saw themselves as the only hope for global communism against traitorous capitalists. Memorized the Little Red Book.
**Isolation**. By taking over the country. Controlling the media. Though at the beginning, outside of harms way, and while the country struggled with wars, they recruited. This later expanded, but the isolation of the rectification was psychological. Universally created their own groups and attacked the rest of society.
**Elites**. Despite it being for the masses, it only recruited a percentage, based on merit (or connections) to become part of a ruling class. Levels of prestige. Need to work. Need rectification. Super nationalists. Even when fighting other Chinese in both revolutions, they felt they were saving China and the world. The "vanguard of revolutionary change".
**Leader**. Mao had been correct before, built up rebellion before, and got away (with great difficulty). Hero of the battle-scared group. Legendary survival. Only grew in populariy after. Became an idol. His every word was the truth. When Mao’s followers attacked their elders, they saw themselves as the embattled few saving the world when they were, in fact, already in total control. They believed Mao when he told them otherwise, regardless of the evidence in front of their eyes.

>  Mao’s biggest departure from the cults we looked at earlier is that he made all of this happen to a population of a billion, not the forty of Heaven’s Gate or even the (alleged) tens of thousands once in Aleph. A billion. The most populous country in the world. And yet all the tactics that seemed to serve a small, dedicated group like a religious cult worked here. In a country they controlled, they still felt isolated. In an elite group of specially picked members, they still felt special and unique. In a place that had already been reinvented as a Communist nation once, they still had to do it again. And in a land of a billion, nobody was able to point out the absurdities in how beliefs changed so wildly.

## Comments
Unlike in real life. Cults can be **right**.
Gods might permit cults with an extreme read on their teachings.

### Psychological comment
> Cults do not operate though elitism. It may appear that way on the surface, but in actuality a lot of cults operate to entice the open minded. In psychology, Openness is a trait that people have and cults look for two traits among people to latch onto: People with high agreeability, and people with high openness, bonus points for people who are high in conscientiousness and by extent judgmental personalities.
> The reasons why cults seek these personality types out isn't a conscious thing, there isn't a mastermind controlling the cult in the real world, instead, these personality types seek the new way of thinking coupled with the community.
Isolation is not necessarily intentional.
> this is the community wanting to stay a community. Cults, as in all members, do not like it when members leave, the fantasy of the cult, the community that protects them and transforms them to be more than what they are. So that thing that causes conflict within the community is an enemy. This is where Agreeability rears it's ugly side, like mama bear, she will rip you apart if you touch her cubs. No doubt you have met a person with high agreeability who will be kind and nurturing, but will be outright hostile to threats to their sensibilities. This is cult like behavior and it's how cults maintain themselves.
Flexibility also due to community over belief.
> The belief is a vehicle, and if that belief is wrong then the community is shaken. This is why you will see cults attack criticism, it's not because they're disrupting their master plan, it's because you're threatening their perceived safety and unity.
Innocense potential:
> Cult members are not evil, not even the leader (most times) They are more like adults who want to be children, they're sad and lost in the world and want to return to a safe place where mom and dad are at the wheel, driving the car with them in the back of the car. But as Jet Black said, there is nothing more pure and cruel as a child.
