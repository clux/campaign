## Guilt trip ideas
Letters on guards:
Dear Edmund, I'm sorry you were forced to take a job so far away from us. I know you don't trust the person offering the work, and neither did I... but the baby and little Grog would never survive the coming winter if it wasn't for you. Good thing you'll just be helping out a small town maintain order and not fighting a war or something. We could never afford to lose you and we're all so grateful for such a brave and selfless husband and father. Come home to us soon. Love, Emeline.

Mis U Dady. Luv Grog.
