Dear Edmund, I'm sorry you were forced to take a job so far away from us. I know you don't trust the person offering the work, and neither did I... but the baby and little Grog would never survive the coming winter if it wasn't for you. Good thing you'll just be helping out a small town maintain order and not fighting a war or something. We could never afford to lose you and we're all so grateful for such a brave and selfless husband and father. Come home to us soon. Love, Emeline.

Mis U Dady. Luv Grog.

## Reverse Message Troll (NAVY seals copypasta)
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I finished top of my class in the Tower Arcane, and I've been involved in numerous mercenary raids on Menzoberranzan, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in evocation magic and I'm the top battle mage in the Undying Soul. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over Message?

Think again, fucker. As we speak I am summoning my secret network of undead across the shadowfell and your message is being scryed on right now so you better prepare for the horde, maggot. The horde that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with basic cantrips. Not only am I extensively trained in Fireball, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the school of magic and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the multiverse, you little shit.

If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.
