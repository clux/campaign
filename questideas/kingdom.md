## Kingdom Style Intro
Idea for a eastern undead setup. Good themes from the show that translate to undead mystery. A bit of a lower level thing though.

A city starving – and they'll be low on resources after their travel.

One of the inhabitants will offer up a mysterious feast to the citizens.
Eventually they'll all turn undead as a consequence.
Orchestrating wraith/something escapes leaving a trail to the Acropolis.

### Alternative:
Barred off city. Stakes/polearms planted in the ground as makeshift fences. Black goop all over the weapons.
Spikes all over the walls. Blood smeared on walls.
Barred off front door. Lots of wooden stuff thrown in front.
Locked from the inside. Have to climb the spikes (tied with rope to the other side).

Tons of spikes on the inside lined up towards the centre. As if used to protect themselves from something. Blood all over the bamboo ends.

Bamboo => monk area?

Rotting smell.
Piles of corpses under the floor boards.
They'll have to pull them out.
THey're all tied together.
48 corpses. One unaccounted for.
(Corpses were originally chasing in hiders under the floorboards and got pinned down from above)

**Meanwhile**
Royals drinking and eating rice with geishas.
Incompetent, trying to understand, but clearly never dealt with this amount of loss before.
Trying to act tough.
Dumping corpses in idyllic river. Tieing them down with a rock. Hundreds of corpses down there.
Water toxic?

**Ultimately**
The plant brings them back as undead, was used by kings confidantes.
King is kept artificially alive on the plant (as a monster) so that her pregnant wife becomes the heir to the throne rather than the prince. He's shackled in his chamber most of the time.
Maybe the herb was a gift from the necromancers as a way to gain more foothold?
They want to rule through the queen (to raise a son quickly). She's innocent and naïve. He can rule rather than the prince.

**MainQuestline0**: follow the escaped prince into city
he'll want to know why he's being framed?
As citizens get bitten, there's more to fight. Though it may take a minute to convert.

**MainQuestline1**: missing cleric:
Missing cleric/physician (survor from the barred off place) in frozen valley.
Looking for plants that bring the dead back to live.

Find cleric harvesting on icicles in a cave. She's terrified looking and desperate. Holding an ice-pick.
"The plant caused everything that happened."
"Bodies have been moved? NO. Those bodies were not dead. This must be stopped."

Physician will want to make her way back to warn everyone.
Warning will be ignored, and as she's about to be arrested for hystericalness, they start imperceptibly twitching as the sun moves behind a cloud.

Later they rise, the ring style. Bones breaking. First one is recognised as someone's wife, husband rushes in foolishly, gets eaten. Others wake, panic ensues.

**MainQuestline1b**: rescue cleric
She can lead you to the king or look for a cure?
Ultimately the main city burns (not the one with the king) as they are overrun.
They're stuck inside and slowly being overrun by prisoners. Try to barricade, but difficult. Sword through the head kills them + burn corpses.
The longer the spend, the more the undead start overrunning the civilisation.

**Questline2**: find town
Discover bodies rising during autopsies and identification.
Someone from the city rushes in desperately tries to burn the corpses unsuccessfully.

**Questline3**: interrogate newbie
Will give them some heads up.

**Questline4**: get arrested for interference?
Can lead to the kings prison?
Alternatively resist arrest in 1v1.

**Questline5**: mysterious box jumps around
Revealing hiding space underneath. One dead key figure in there waking up?
Maybe scrap that.

**MainQuestline1c**: survive the long night
at this point probably diverge..
They'll  get full info on why at this point.
No one wants to kill their families. Lots of complaints.
Nobles just want to burn the peasants
Crown prince will reveal himself for their incompetence at this point.
And want them to send survivors away to safety.

**Main Questline1d**: defeat waves
Proper planning needed. Oil, weaponry?
Multiple checkpoints. Fire signals to keep in sync?
Plan for night, but it wasn't the night.
Twist: other source (heat?) behind undead return.
They may rest too soon.

**Main Questline 1e**: trojan horse king
Send in a box to the kings confidantes.

**Frozen Valley**
True ressurection plan region.
Purple pansies growing in a cave. Strings with bells notifying of intruders. Manacles hanging from ceiling.
Small pond in middle.
Abandoned "mini-research lab"
