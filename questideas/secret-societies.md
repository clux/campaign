## Secret Societies
Things to consider with compelling thieves guilds / secret societies.
1. **Membership** - Identify a need that is not being met. Your group needs something, but it is withheld. Substances / Gold / Political Sway. Once goals are attained, the new goals grow and morph. Member base might change.
2. **Organisation** - How does a person become a leader among these aggrieved members? What qualifications did they have, how did it shape the group? Is he radical?
3. **Goals** - What problems does a group have, what do leaders to do address these grievances? Solution might be stepping stone, or all that the leadership understands. Can anyone contribute, no matter how shady?
4. **Secrecy** - What purpose does secrecy serve the organisation. Afraid of found? Why? What powers are likely to find them, and what will happen then? Don't be nebulous here. Smugglers afraid of one guard captain? Cultists afraid of one religious leader cracking down? Maybe secrecy isn't simple; shadow cabinet. Parallel organisations. They could operate in the open, but choose not to.
5. **Tensions** - Conflict, resolution, storytelling arise from how each step of the way the group gets further away from the reasons that first created the group. A secret society benefits from the idiosyncratic choices tha tlead to where it is because each offers new avenues for tensions that your party can explore. Maybe the party can unravel the web, and dethrone leaders, or change the organisation.

### Triads
Based in local identities within China. Groups of people originating in the same area, but living in a new one. Diaspora.
Poorest people usually. A helping system for people to stay afloat in a new location.
Might work for leaders of both sides of official rule, and offer dirty contracts on behalf of Chinese rulers.
State sponsored organised crime.
Secrecy forced on the organisation.
Unregulated, because all underhand deals.
The people are loyal to the people in the group, not where they live, so are open to a lot.
Tension; serve your people in strange lands, but you are taken over by the rich and powerful who have no reason to support you.
### The Literary Society (1911 Revolution)
Few human rights, emperialism feeding on China.
New group pushing for a revolution and a democratic government.
In the past revolutionary propagandists and organisation tried to recruit military into their plots by pitching directly to recruits. Soldiers generaly could not join revolutionary organisations in a safe way, so they made their own.
Small groups like Literary Society got together tot alk about the revolution and how to recruit new members from within their units.
Goal was to overthrow the Qing dynasty through military conversion, but military has always sided with the throne.
By having multiple tiny barely connected groups it made it untraceable (even to other revolutionary).
Every organisation had the same plan, and it just kind of worked at the end when one group started making bombs, and one detonated.
Secrecy made this possible, but also made they had no idea of what they were doing and who to trust.
Their leader; guy that was going to be executed for being in a revolutionary group, and they just begged him to become their leader.
Secrecy meant they had no friends, didn’t know who to contact, didn’t know who to trust, so they ended up trusting a guy who did not want to be there.
By the time real revolutionary leaders who had been trying to start this revolution for decades showed up, the revolution was full of bandwagoners.
Once it was time to move beyond the small, secret group phase, their organization and beliefs worked against them. They believed, pretty earnestly, that all these people jumping on the bandwagon must be revolutionaries coming from their own secret groups, or at least have been converted to the idea of overthrowing the Emperor. As they found, some of their allies were generally behind overthrowing the throne, but only so they could take it themselves.
### The Communist International
Funded by Lenin; international alliance of Communist parties.
Feared that the communist experiment in the USSR would not last and Russia would be torn apart; they needed friends.
Tried to train, arm, guide other Communist partiet hoping they could turn into Soviet allies.
A lot of revolutionaries saw Marxism as sort of the next step in the evolution of governmen.
Marx was persuasive to people.
Even pragmatic people were concerned about the fate of their backwards nations, were persuaded by the idea of skipping ahead in the evolution of government, to eventually surpass even their better of rival countries.
Membership kind 1: parties looking to ComIntern to be a participating member in a global communist movement without borders.
Membership kind 2: actual ComIntern agents sent into the field to help the parties self-organise.
The agents were under pressure from Soviet leaders to instill a paternalistic view of ComIntern (the others wouldn't work alone).
The parties wanted to be equal members, but the soviets wanted affiliants. Agents stood in the middle.
Tension played out in these conflicting goals. Some agents pressured to be heavy handed, leading to fractures.
Tension played out in structure; agents assumed they'd be in charge even in countries they did not know. They knew theory (via Lenin/Marx directly even), but not practice (Quote from Mao).
Mao could reach the average Chinese person through exeperience in revolution; how to fight mountain battles, plant and contact undercover agents. Stuff not covered by the Communist Manifesto.
Secrecy; they were a giant boogeyman. Outside agenst coming in and starting a revolution? Set the stage for a later cold war.
Stalin disbanded ComIntern before that.
Secrecy was about what they were up to. Even the agents themselves did not understand where things were going.
Backfired. Parties also felt a lack of cohesive movement from ComIntern.
Parties couldn't trust advice and leadership when decisions were shrouded in mystery.
Parties were not part of the decision making process, and they were not sure who were benefitting.

### Pirates
### Cartel / Mafia
Cause people to be indebted to you and force them to work for you. Geas?
Not state sponsored. But organised crime. TODO: why not cracked down on?
