This ability can be used as many times as you can create shadows.
- **Lore**: Many a demigod fought and killed over control of this blade, a perfect conduit for whatever deity to protect its followers. While originally created for priests to pass their god's will and shield others, it soon grew tainted with the greed of lesser gods. A false prophet currently holds this blade, hiding in dark caves along with its fearful followers, but both him and this blade can be cleansed through blood.
