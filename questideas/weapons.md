See [[houserules]] for some ideas from pathfinder + grit/glory

### Blood-Oath
Weapon (shortsword), artifact (requires attunement by a warlock, cleric, or paladin)
Those who swear by this blade, live through.
While attuned to this weapon, you gain proficiency in Intimidation.

- **Draining Presence**: This weapon has a -5 penalty on its attack rolls. Attacks with it deal 1d6 slashing damage plus 3d6 necrotic.
- **Meat Shield**: By attacking a willing ally, you can give yourself invulnerability for 3 combat rounds.
- **Shadow of Death**: You can make a shadow emerge from the blade as an action, taking the form of a humanoid, this is considered an illusion and will only vanish if touched. This can be used twice per day, recharging both uses at dawn.

A traitor’s will still lives in this blade, and it can only be purged with blood.

#### Awakened
- **Requirements**: Stabbing yourself with the blade and letting in your patron/god.
- **Invigorating Power**: This weapon now has a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls, along with its regular damage.
- **Blood-Trust**: As a bonus action you can stab yourself, rolling regular damage for the blade plus any modifiers, to give invulnerability to all allies in a 60ft radius
- **Aura of Grandeur**: As a bonus action, after you kill an enemy, you can create one shadow with your blade that looms over every enemy that can see you for one moment, failing a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw, they become frightened of you. This ability can be used as many times as you can create shadows.
- **Lore**: Many a demigod fought and killed over control of this blade, a perfect conduit for whatever deity to protect its followers. While originally created for priests to pass their god's will and shield others, it soon grew tainted with the greed of lesser gods. A false prophet currently holds this blade, hiding in dark caves along with its fearful followers, but both him and this blade can be cleansed through blood.

### Ward of Innocence
Weapon (quarterstaff), artifact (requires attunement by a wizard or druid)
A staff said to be held by a Goddess of War, who gave her life to save those devoted to her.
While attuned to this weapon, you have advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws.

- **Burden of Duty**: As a reaction, you can use the Shield spell on another creature. If the attack still hits, you and the targeted creature divide the damage between the two. This can be used two times per day, recharging both uses at dawn.
- **Will of Steel**: You gain a +1 bonus to your Armor Class as long as you have an ally 30ft of you.
- **Smite the Deserving**: You gain a +1 bonus to you spell attack rolls and to your spell save DC, this bonus is doubled if it targets a creature that damaged you this turn.

The staff’s power remains dormant, the remnants of the Goddess still waiting for a worthy wielder.

#### Awakened
- **Requirements**: Die while protecting someone with the Burden of Duty.
- **Worthy Soul**: Your bonus to your Armor Class, spell attack rolls and spell save DC is now +2. Your uses of Shield using this staff are now four and can also target yourself.

- **Light of Hope**: As an action, you can order the staff to light in a radius of 60ft. Undead that see this light target you instinctively.
- ​**Lore**: Created by the Goddess Vandria Gilmadrith, this staff has a single purpose: To protect others. Hidden amongst the treasure of a group of sea-faring bandits lies the staff, unused, and waiting for a worthy soul that strives to protect others.

### Blink
Weapon (dagger), artifact (requires attunement by a creature of demonic of holy descendance)
A set of 3 silver daggers with ancient runic inscriptions on the grip, they act as a singular blade, never separate from each other.
While attuned to this set, as long as you are holding one of the daggers, you can teleport to the location of any of the other two, granted that they are at least 30ft away from you.
These daggers emit a constant electrical discharge, raising the user’s hairs and giving a slight shock to anyone who touches them.

**Life Spark**: On a hit, the daggers do 1d6 lightning damage along with the regular 1d4 damage, these are considered magical weapons for the purpose of damage.

You feel the power of thunder rustling inside this blade, awaiting to be unleashed.

Your body receives 2d4 force damage due to the strain of moving at suck high speeds. This ability can only be used once per day, recharging each dawn.
- ​**Lore**: An artifact stolen by a cult that despises *Insert race of your PC*. Crafted by an unknown deity, the cult knows that only a person of that race can truly wield its powers, so they are capturing every member of that race in order to release the magic that binds these daggers to that race.
