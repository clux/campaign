You delved down into the Cursed Grove with the aid of Lahevik Goatweaver, while Dohznak “rested” with the kobolds. You fought your ways through strange caverns, where great rifts in the earth had taken its toll.

Thanks to the less than stealthy approaches by Lahevik
- hobgoblins + grenl (macabre torture)
- fought Balsag and his rats
- blessed Meepo with the dragon statue
- fought belak + sir bradford + sharwyn

And as we left off. Sharwyn falls, Belak stands lifeless, encased in bark. And a piece of red fruit visible on the tree itself.

Players:
- Verity
