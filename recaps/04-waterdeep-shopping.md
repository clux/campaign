Left Sunken Citadel. Saw a fungal creature chasing them around, huge, demonic.

Swallowed up the entire town.

They grabbed a wagon and hitched a ride home.
Gael gave you many potions as reward for the red fruit (though you treated it with great suspion).
Met `Sszynrae` (drow with a pirate hat) gave them a ring to meet Vizeran deVir in Araj. (captain of the guards sent him). They traveled up for days, and were captured by the drow on the way there, and found themselves In Velkynvelve.
