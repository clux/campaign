You reached `Sloobludop`, a kua-toa village on the shore of Darklake. Led by `Shooshar`, it quickly became evident that he was not universally considered their saviour, and they had their own conflicting ideas of worship. Taken in by archpriest `Ploop` worshipping their Deep Sea Mother, he presented a plan to overthrow a newly minted rival archpriest `Blopp` worshipping a rival Deep Sea Father.

 You went along with the plan and were presented as sacrificial offerings at the altar to the Deep Sea Father. There the sacrificial ritual started, and with the kua-toa united, they all start chanting for `Leemooggoogoon` - the Deep Sea Father. In the middle of the archpriest's speech, `Ploop` initiates the betrayal whereupon you all gang up on `Bloop` and her surprised minions with your concealed weapons. Massive damage is dealt in the first round, `Bloop` is heavily injured, but your unfortunate position in the center of the shrine means that none of you are safe.

Things are looking good for `Ploop`, the rival archpriest is almost dead despite a mass cure wounds on her side, but trouble stirs in the darklake. Foaming bubbles and kua-toa dragged into the lake are precursors to four large tentacles bursting forth from the lake. A huge demonic creature ascends with two huge baboon like heads, eyes glowing red, and arms that split into two long tentacles. The creature sends a deafening roar from its two heads. The demon lord `Demogorgon` rolls for initiative.

`Bron` runs as fast as possible, `WindSorrow` helps `Mordai` get up before spending a ki point to book it as well - `Mordai` just sees this shadow of a monk that quickly help him up, before he too has the chance to run out of there. Two rounds of running and Demogorgon has slammed his necrotic tentacles down upon two rows of stunned kua-toa and eaten the last remaining archpriest.

An hour later, the village is in ruins, you all suffer from various forms of indefinite madness after witnessing a demon lord on the loose. The only thing you manage is to loot the remains of the village before casting off in Darklake with `Stool` in search of a friendlier place, your bets hedged on the `Neverlight Grove`â€¦
