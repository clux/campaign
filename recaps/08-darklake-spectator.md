You spent several days rowing across `Darklake`, where at a southern point you met a deep gnome. `Suooll` represented the `Blue Shadow`; an organisation of armed scavengers selling gear in `Gracklstugh`. Despite his inverted voice, you obtained a small list of items available for purchase at their temporary holding station in `Atishalla`.

With the prices being a little on the high side, you opted to purchase information about an abandoned wizard lair, with promises of riches guarded only by a "sentry".

The three of you ventured to the lair of `Lirthuqo` where you were greeted by gazes of many eyes. Through scorching rays of fire from `Mordai`, and hard-hitting sharpshooter projectiles, a pair of gazing Nothics were dispatched of at its entrance.

In the main chamber - after a deep descent - you found yourself trapped in the lair of the four-eyed beholder spectator `Lirthuqo`, who eagerly charged up his eye-rays. Your out-of-range `WindSorrow` was the main victim of this violent staring contest, handling an impressive 6 successful wisdom saving throws in a row.

The beholder's wounding ray, combined with various lair actions caused a tough battle that downed both `Mordai` and `WindSorrow`, and ended with your monk, unconscious on the floor - your healing magic fully exhausted - while a final eldritch blast launched deep into the beast's throat caused it to sink lifelessly towards the floor at round 4.

A second burning weapon was obtained in the blue fires of its lair, along with enough silver to buy you two protective magic items from the Blue Shadow. With your warlock familiar summoned, and new items attuned, the Grove awaits..
