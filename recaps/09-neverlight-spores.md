You ventured into the `Neverlight Grove`. Greeted by a field of mushrooms and zhurkwoods that you managed to awake, you eventually appeased the creature with the help of Stool's surprising persuasion skills. Though not without a critical reaction hit from the tree to oneshot `Pendleblip`.

In the grove you met with sovereigns `Phylo` and `Basida`. The enthusiastic former who wanted to take you on a tour of the `Garden of Welcome` and show you 'The great seeder', and the latter who instead wanted you to investigate the garden alone at his request. After helping out the leader of the hunters, taking down a charging, twisted shambling mound of flesh (with excellent long range damage dealing), you got some healing potions from `Basida` and rested up before exploring further.

`Bron` climbed into the garden alone, wherein he found numerous heads, all screaming or hissing, buried from the head down, covered with fungal growths and open wounds. After retrieving his companions (who could converse in undercommon), they all climbed their way up with his now attached rope.

A drow warned about the seeder, saying it was a trap from the lady of decay, and requesting as best it could to be put out of its misery. Not long after, a corrupted larval myconoid `Yestabrod` arose and tried to cut you up with the aid of two Drow Spore Servants, and remote exploded the corpse of this drow in the battle. Through the help of an extremely effective Hideous Laugther you took down this aberrant creature, and thus avoided further confrontation with a pair of large claw-wielding aberrations charging you. At this point you heard the voice of `Mordai's trapped familiar, who was earlier sent out to track `Phylo`.

Deep within the caverns around the enormous mushroom tower Yggmorgus, `Pendle` retrieved `Azuth`, but failing a madness roll in the process from this proximity.
