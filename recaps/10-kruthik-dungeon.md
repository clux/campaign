After witnessing the disturbingly fertile grounds in the `Garden of Welcome`, along with mock-weddings enacted by possessed myconoids, you leave the `Neverlight Grove` after concerned discussions with the sovereign `Basida`.

`Rasharoo`, the leader of the scouts, is accompanying you on your path to `Blingdenstone` while he and `Stool` scouts out the area for a potential replacement hideout for myconoids that have thus far eluded possession.

Not taking any shit from weird water creatures, you pass quickly through watery caverns and reach clayeyer tunnels overrun by `Kruthiks` - complete with the murdered remains of deep gnomes.

After a vision of eggs and fire from a certain patron, `Mordai 1.` happily goes on an egg popping spree, after which fights with numerous kruthics begin while you venture deeper into their lair.

With the excellent battle tactics of `Mordai 2. (the mad)` you dispatch of numerous reptiles. Though while some attacks seem to be more efficient than others, you welcome your new and second warlock, congratulating him for his arthropod leg branches he has fashioned as horns.

In this condition, `Pendle/Mordai2` is sure to be a valuable member, fully capable of dealing with whatever's inside an ominously large chrysalis. Tune in next week.
