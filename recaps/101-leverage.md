You anxiously waited to hear back from Faey, when you saw a series of devils and efreet waltz in toward the backstage area of the Onyx Octagon.

With some gaseous form shenanigans, you heard the sound of shackling, and talks about selling lawbreakers.

Following the devil entourage to a courthouse you found a series of "spiritual forfeiters" / lawbreakers up for auction for various devils. The setup was pretty anonymous and professional, much more than you've seen in any market back in the prime material.

However, with the prices and anonymity of the auctions the amount of money you would need to get Faey back would be quite exorbitant. You pondered selling your hard earned stuff at a reduced rate, and even had an offer of potentially letting you break in to the Ormolu Complex, but you instead went for a financial solution.

By offering up your items as collateral to the Grand Obsidian Bank (at roughly 75% of market value), you were able to get 240k gold of credit, at a mere 9% interest over the week.

However, should you die (like say in the arena vs. Rak), or fail to return the money by next week, you would lose your items automatically, as per the ritualistic collateralisation spells cast upon them.

So, with fresh credit to spend, you used 120k to get Faey back with his items and soul intact, an unusual choice in the City of Brass, but you made a point of being a collector of powerful creatures.

The rest of your credit you put down 50k on Rak in a fight with a Solar, and a further 50k on yourselves against Rak tomorrow with 8-1 odds against you.

A highly leveraged position, but one that got you 5k for seeing Rak fight for the first time. A clearly very powerful creature, summoning force weapons out of thin air, slaughtering Solar.

So with Faey back, now well rested, you meet up at the Ivory Ducks with Faey to discuss next step. Start.
