Neverwinter Estate
27 April 2021

You spent a day in Neverwinter looking at interesting real estate opportunities after the demon lord attack!

Talking to such reputable ex-pirate estate agencies such as Power Word: Estate and Mordenkainen's Affordable Fortress, you scoped out the Cloak Tower at the eastern side of the city, Castle Never, and the Hall of Justice.

Dissatisfied with the scrying potential of the Cloak Tower, along with the many mutual benefits of Castle Never, you ended up getting a good deal (130k) on the castle itself, the keep, and Chorom's old chambers (including several magical items and potions).

This all provided that you had sensible goals for the castle and visited it at the very least on a weekly basis (after an initial year grace period), and funded people for keeping it in good state. 100gp a week for 20-40 servants.

(quotes: 150k on whole castle never, 20k cloak tower, 20k hall of justice).

(items; winged boots, ring of regeneration, crystal ball (telepathy), potions: healing 5x supreme, 1 speed, 1 heroism, clairvoyance, sharpness, cloud giant str, invisibility, animal friendship, philter of love)

You also have a potential deal for the Halls of Justice for a quarter of the price, provided you can bring two more followers of Kavaki to prove that Goatweaver's sight is a reliable method of judgement.

How exactly the judgement will work is up for discussion, as is the name; Hall of Justice; brought to you by Kavaki, or The Kavaki Grey Cloaks Hall of Justice, or Kavaki's Hall of Divine Justice. And then the question of whether Goatweaver himself will do the judgement whenever he's in town or not, or if he can train a suitable judge.

Turns out Galeron was a little suspicious of a the "guilty people shine red" methodology when there's no one else to hold Goatweaver accountable (despite his reputation) - and due to a lack of other "most devout followers" at present, the search is on for proof. Then, it seems, the plan is to provide some education to get more devout followers within the city.
