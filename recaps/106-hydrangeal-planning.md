Hydrangeal Planning
04 May 2021

Got your Kastle Knever / Kastle Kavaki set up right.

Mordai used a week to learn some of the fortifications of the castle (keep level fortifactions unfound), activate the teleportation circle, and scry on a plethora of things. Scried on Irithyll, the insides of Irithyll Cathedral.


You found a bit about the general layout of the city, and the general layout of the upper levels of the Cathedral. Upper levels apparently derelict remains of some named necromancer Larloch.

GW made a ramshackle shrine to Kavaki with flowers out front. A single column with a goat's head on top and some swords planted in the ground trying to woo the lord.

GW did try to convert (scruffy) Jake from Jake Rose's flower shop, who was delivering Hydrangeas of Mystra (which apparently was just a marketing ploy, daughter janet revealed). This was mostly unsuccessful, and Mordai was accidentally killing some of the flowers during all this instead. Flowers not hostile creatures.

In the mean time, you laid plans on how to enter irithyll, you were considering trying to backdoor your way in, which seems hard. Currently, your plan was through the misty path on the southern mountains, past the abandoned pyramid, through the valley, and over the main bridge.

Then possibly, some flight/gas shenanigans, through a warded city, and we'll see what happens.
You stopped by in Waterdeep through an Oak teleport to

DO:
- mention again how much more charismatic GW sounds now, not just the halo +2 cha


TODO: extinction non-detection
TODO:
- need one crazy old undead that knows of larloch and the hidden cathedral area
- Arklem phylactery not with Iraes
- time viewing Arklem
- Arklem's spellbook
- rotund skeleton
- gaseous form protection? dimension door?
they think they can fly, but it doesn't work
need to talk to crazy undead

want to take out arklem without him having prepared
scry on arklem through his body afterwards
faey has manacles (cover his mouth? telepathy, cover his face?)
they know this probably wont work
but if they kill him, they can take out his items
phylactery in the pyramid?
kill arklem before irae
first: magic supplies in WD, then something something irithyl, but conceal magic
