Blood-Ception
18 May 2021

You snuck into Irithyll Cathedral and found the many numerous notes of an ancient elven mage named Larloch in various time zones, in three different libraries.

The first, 400-420DR (1000y ago), it's clearly his younger days, studing the biology and botany of the city.

Then, more and more strange magic, with (best you can tell) some afterburner type super-powerful fire spells, and mentions of a calamity, seemingly a crash in around 540DR.

Finally, more into full-blown paranoia, dark seldarine pantheon, Kiaransalee, prophecies (one of which was highlighted), and distrust for his wizard + cleric companion, then nothing.

You found a body that had died spectacularly a long time ago after that, and a blood trail into a literal blood bath. Who it was is still undecided, but your bets are on Larloch.

The blood bath, after dubiously activating its entrance (gw dunking it in the bath and praying to kavaki), found that it was hiding a magic protected entrance to an oubliette; the much referenced sealed caverns still had a way in.

In the caverns, you found strange milky and light-shining water, casting light upon the hard blue walls. You also found a Revenant Zombie, trapped with some kind of fireball inside of him.

After careful trailing around the various paths, with varying degrees of stealth, you inspected some blue, rocky poop, you avoided one ambush, but got yourself into another.

So, as we left off; mordai, take 13 points of psychic damage. Faey, roll to hit. Carry on combat.

TODO:
- TODO: finalize combat
- seed the skipper
- get across that the prophecy pertains to the 3 undying souls are needed to summon Kiaransalee.
- CORRUPTING INFLUENC OF SHADOWFELL (didn't really get it across with Larloch)
- Arkelm counters; to dimensional shackles / face covering?
- need fleshing out arklem's items (spellbook), his phylactery (done), motivations
- Arklem surprise plans (he can't see them, but alerted of intruders now)
- Saphire poop to seed Blue Salamander (failed to get them to try to find it..)
