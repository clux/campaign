TL:DR Fought Kruthik queen. Almost wiped to spider encounter.

Paul's alive. He's carrying the chitinous remains of the kruthik hive queen ^^
@april glaived it down with her genasi fighter `Hjarka`

Yeah, you killed the queen pretty easily actually, with the help of some restoring potions from Rasharoo. The spider fight on the way to `Blingdenstone` thereafter was sketchier.

Still, you reached the inner gates, without further madness :-)
