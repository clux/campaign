110-red-team

Malexis fight, tiefling, summons Vrocks, and other devils from a safe ledge in the ceiling while having anti-magic field. GW only managed a drive-by flight maul before his wings was rendered useless from the AMF - for then to plummet into the ground (and get petrified by the other devil, not the greatest combat for GW).

You did eventually exhaust his devil companions, which he seemed pretty sad about, and Faey ported up and used the Shove Action to have him plummet to the ground.
Intimidate Malexis, pretending to be security contractors for Arklem (huge deception rolls), he shows you around, doesn't know how to use the pool, but you push him relentlessly so he just tries the same thing AMF in pool, and the Tesseract drops.

You leave with it, and some magical items. Teleport. Good rolls. Waste first scroll, but beat the CHA20 dc roll to beat the ward. -> Outskirts shadowfell/pyramid. Venture out.
Tree to Icewind Dale, talk to Adalon. Catch up, he investigates the book describing pocket plane construction (indescructible netherese magic) and gives you some ideas on how to get into it (Plane Shift, but requiring rotational stability across planes || matching angular momentum in containing chamber)
His place is under Private Sanctum. You get his teleportation circle, provided you do not use it without nondetection, and head to waterdeep.


TODO: chronomancy rules? (he has a book, a book on how to use it, plus power source)
