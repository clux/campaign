### Wiz Tower
Mordai wins (remained with 4hp after solo GW)
GW smashed Faey in a few rounds, but tanked unstable singularity and ended up taking a lot of damage being in the middle of both of them (common theme)

### Ysgardian Guarden
Faey wins in a solo stunlock fight with Mordai at the end
despite being roflstomped by GW in round 1 with a sick dimension door into crit smite

did many things right:
- found healing chamber, passed without a trace there while GW took out mordai
- deflected unstable singularity
- crit sneak shot GW

Players:
- Florent
- Guy
- Jay
