GW prepared a final feast with all sorts of meats, bread, and spicy options before getting on a ride towards the shadowfell.

Based on [[skipper]]'s suggestion; you take his shark slide down to the Black Doctor, you drag your way down into the lake with his phantom steed-powered engine. Finding yourself anchoring upside down in a reverse lake overlooking a green river running down from a large fortified gate, you make your way up the mountainpath. Invisible, flying, and fully stealthed.

You saw a large bulky zombie and a drow consort doing the rounds on the path, while you scout out the city from beyound an unknown ward.

Seeing a large conical colluseum, a tetrahedral black pyramid, a large stalagtite structure (eastern side), the two of you dimension door to the empty colluseum, while Faey finds his way in with invisibility and shadowstep, narrowingly avoiding the gaze of a drow inquisitor on post.

You meet up and discuss the next course of action, thinking the pyramid makes the most sense based on where Mordai got pulled with his scrying. While you discuss, Irae ports in over the town square and a large winged statue, and some commotion happens there.

Avoiding this setup, you make your way towards the pyramid, noticing a gaggle of drow women discussing a book (called Shadowmantle by Edvard Feeler (Black Tentacles guy)).

Passing swiftly ahead, towards the entrance to the pyramid, you notice that the beam of energy is actually liquid pouring down from the mist above through the center of the pyramid. However, as you look on and plan on entering, Mordai's invisibility drops.

A drow inquisitor on the side has seen you and dispelled the invisibility as you all head into combat.

TODO:
- zhurkwood somewhere
- combat plan; inquisitor has truesight, insect plague, harm, but what does he summon?
- shadowdragon ? sorrowsword: https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/268-sorrowsworn-are-the-shadowfells-most-despair
- irae drop by?
- how do they get up to the acropolis? teleportation setup inside

NOTES:
- chronomancy use, narrate black weave around mordai
- retry book loot: put on some of the women there to loot, or elsewhere
