119-felgolos-reborn
10 August 2021

You ventured through the [[acropolis]] in [[velddrinnsshar]] and fought [[felgolos]] - reborn as a dracolich - with [[arklem]].

It was a long and gruelling battle.

- Faey went down early in the battle against a 6th level Harm
- but came back losing only one round after getting a his next round Nat 20 death save.

Felgolos did huge damage with the LG breath weapon on Mordai (twice, once on GW).
However, despite being out of Lay of Hands, GW was managing to tank most of the dragon damage while the rest of you tried to snipe Arklem.

Arklem, however, while not a particularly beefy mage, had his fair share of buffs and scary things that kept him up and kept him deadly:

- 22 AC (27 with shield)
- 25 spell DC
- Armor of Agathys at 8th level
- (Freedom of Movement - not discovered)
- Heal at 7th
- Chronomancy Spells to double cast (either conc or non-conc)
- Ray of Frost 4d8 cantrip with +14 to hit
- Dimension Door to get around

The dimension door turned out to be the crucial difficulty here, because while you tanked and gradually dealt with the dragon. Arklem could move out of his pinned position, and corner a low Mordai and take him down.

At this point, Felgolos had sustained a massive 600 damage (above the as-written max pool of 459), and fell to GW's reaction maul. The reaction here actually avoided the dragon's last attack that turn and this kept GW barely alive.

GW tries to taunt Arklem and get him to come out, while Faey tries to snipe him. Gets him low.

Arklem uses mirror image, and gives himself a free round, which he uses to finish off Mordai.

The round after, GW + Faey attack, but only takes out his his duplicates.
Arklem does one Ray of Frost on GW and plans to exit. It misses. We roll for whether to attack the mortally wounded GW or leave, he attacks. He hits, but with GW's resistance he's at 1HP.

At this point, Arklem knows he has to leave. The two of them will finish him. But he now has to survive one last round. One arrow hits, he has to use Shield to survive. The shield makes him dodge all of GW's hits, and he can dimension door up to the top where he gets sneak attacked by Faey. He's at 10hp, concentration dropped. Next attacks all miss. GW too far away. Arklem's next turn comes, and with almost no spell slots left, dimension doors out.

He's not far. But all of you are wounded. Finding the scroll of revivify, you bring back Mordai (the second time today).
You take a moment to heal, and scan the surrounding rooms.

Skeleton reforming in lower left room (can be used before the middle part of [[acropolis]]'s inner sanctum).


TODO:
- remind Guy that he has chrono recharge (they can probably finish of Arklem)
- skeletal foreshadowing finalize
- tell people on Saturday whether to run or not
- HOW TO SETUP BATTLE IF THEY LONG REST?
- IF THEY SHORT REST THEY CAN HUNT HIM DOWN EASILY
- IF THEY LONG REST; KIARANSALEE LIKELY
- CAST SPELLS THE ROD OF ABSORPTION CAN TANK!


NOTES:
- but the lich is in another castle
