9th September 2018

This week, you've survived the flirtatious clutches of `Tappy Foamstrap` in the `Foaming Mug`, as well as the condescending comments of `Kazook Pickshine`, and various other totally distinguishable characters without causing any major trouble in `Blingdenstone`.

Insect armor is possibly being commissioned, various alchemical ingredients are ready to go, and you've got some rubies to help you out after finding a secret stash in the abandoned house of a svirfneblin poltergeist.

Will you hit up the goldwhisker clan in the west for chief `Dorbo`? Will it rain oozes in `Blingdenstone`? Will you find out any more potential drow or medusas and discover the source of the elemental banes of `Rockblight`? Will `Hjarka` enjoy being part elemental in `Rockblight`? Will April even be there? Tune in next Tuesday.
