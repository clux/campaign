121-kiaransal-three
24 August 2021

You found yourself in the presence of a newly summoned God, as [[kiaransalee]] walks in the acropolis in [[velddrinnsshar]] after being finzlised by [[irae]].

The three souls that went in: [[irae]], [[larloch]], [[valindra]].

Kiaransalee's form shifted (at least every turn), and has different resistances and abilities apparently based on the aspects of those who formed her.

You reckoned Irae was her white form, with at least:
- (White): Scythe wielding & Weakness Radiant, Normal Bludgeon/Force, Immune Necrotic

Then two other forms (presumably Larloch and Valindra), one of which purple, one of which green (don't know which):
- (Purple): Necrotic Stare (crazy dmg) Immunte to Physical, Normal Radiant/Necrotic
- (Green): Weakness Bludgeoning, Immune Radiant (actually all magic)

The first weakness you found was by [[faey]] who used radiant on the white form, actually did quite a bit of damage with radiant crit arrow. (Actually think this would have been 132 points: ![](121-kiaransal-three-faey-crit.png) with radiant buff.)

However, not enough to stop her, you triggered a teleport into twin scythe attacks which killed him (faey) after a nasty crit in return.

Thankfully, after this, her form changed to Green, she took a maul, and ported out.

Wasting little time, you intimidated Faey back to life from his younger Fawn Self.
Ignoring some minor difficulties climbing the battlemap.

BREAK

You carried on upstairs, found Irae's and Arklem's chambers. Plans, timelines, journals. You investigated a bit, and brought the rest with you.

They heisted Orcus on the seas near the Pit of Hatred to gain the Wand of Orcus.
They tricked Celerom into fighting for them, when Irae just wanted an army.

Read about the Vengeance of Kiaransalee. Many questions still unanswered:
- vengenance against who / vengenance achieved how / vengeance to take place where?

You skimmed a bit about [[valindra]] who came willingly into the union and sacrificed herself, whereas [[larloch]] did not.

You messed up the summoning setup, two inactive quartz crystals, and one - presumably felgolos - still active. You cast sending to it, but it came back with a sinister voice (he's a dracolich now.. - actually rolled d20 for it: 7)
You bagged Felgolos' crystal.

Making your way back you:
- desecrating the land with a kavaki shrine (drow suck)
- repay your debts - while pondering on the etiquette of a cloud giant queen spork handling.
before finally finding a very jolly (firbolg style) fir tree to take you to NW.

In Neverwinter you went through your items.

Items:
* Chambers:
  - Old bag of holding - (with components to potentially get to Maerimydra, but it seemed uncertain if there was any point to it, she's part of Kiaransalee now - the other phylacteries were deactivated)
  - Iridium Galvanizer
  - 1 dried Gloom flower (got 2 fresh ones from Snurka)
  - Sovereign Glue
  - 2xPotion of Supreme Healing
  - Potion of Cloud Giant Strength
  - Arrow of Dragon Slaying 3
  - Purple Ring with Larloch inscribed on inside (GW paid 50gp to change to massive embossed KAVAKI letters on outside), lets wielder cast Thaumaturgy
* Irae
  - Eye of Vengeance
  - The Banshee's Spectral Veil
  - (Scythe take by Kiaransalee)
* Arklem
  - Arcane Grimoire +3
  - Robe of the Archmagi +2
  - Wand of Orcus (variant) yet to be identified

NOTES:
- wand of orcus scene re-prep
  * Wand of Orcus can unveil the interaction between Kiaransalee and Orcus, how Orcus granted lichood initially (god of undeath), but clashed with K, and the wand was lost (and in my version, after retrieving it, Arklem + Irae stole it from his avatar in the prime material)
- Found bag (
- Ideas from last bits of Tiamat => High stakes play. Encourage conditions that can weaken her before she is summoned.
- Neverwinter battle setup!
- They have components to make 2 necro res potions (dried one will fail).

TODO:
- SCRY on kiaransalee (she's wrecking [[menzo]])
- kiaransalee travel into boss fight finalize. she doesn't improve now, right?
- [[kiaransalee]] stats remember properly
- HOW TO FIGURE OUT THE REST OF KIARANSALEE? They got a lot...
  * Seed sight of Kiaransalee?
  * Seed resistances of Valindra and Larloch.. will feel unfair.
  * Seed triggers! Didn't happen in fight because i fucked up force dmg..
  * Seed social triggers (contradictions of creation..)
- gregor final
