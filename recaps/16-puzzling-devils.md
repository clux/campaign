9th of Oct 2018
You left `Blingdenstone` after a bit of resting and armouring up. `Kazook` had a tinkering friend that'd gone missing, and in search of greater powers, you ventured on.

After dispatching / humiliating some Drow scouts sent by `Ilvara`, you deactivated a complicated set of defences, and started looking for this creature and his lab. However, only a confused fey creature was found in a side passage, but offered no useful information.

You fought your way towards the lab, protected by some mechanised shield creatures in a hall with a deactivated shield guardian.

In the main lab, a chain devil along with two spined devils sought a debt to be repaid with violence. A currency that you were able to supply with interest. With a mysterious book partially decoded, and a paywall of a contract signed, trials start on Tuesday.

Players:
- April
