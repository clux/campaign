While Ilvara's notebook did contain some potential leads along with a map of an illithid colony, for now, you enjoy a breath of fresh air as `Kazook` opens up the route back to the surface.

Blood soaked note book of Ilvara contained:
- Kiaransalee (name plus vague speculation)
- Fracto-Nimbuli (name only, later found to be a giant)
- Map of Telnarquel (later believed to be illithid colony)

Kazook uses the lightning source (barrels from devil room) to activate the lightning drill.
