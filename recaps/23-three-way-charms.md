## 23: Nine helps them kill Ctenmiir.
15th January 2019
Nine was the flesh golem.
First introduction of Pegasus (bad summon steed upgrade).
Ooze, orbs, and darkness vampire fight.
Made a [blog post about this](https://clux.github.io/probes/post/2019-01-17-three-way-charm/). It was epic.
They find Whelm.

Players:
- Mordai
- Hjarka
