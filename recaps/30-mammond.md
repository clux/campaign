They then went to the mages guild who were not keen on this. Detected the 9th level Gate spell.
They buff up and gets ready for battle. Heroism for everyone.

It's a hard fight. Way too hard for them, but they win with the help. Pendle turns into a gold statue.

Note to self self: Never do this again. Bad ideas:

- letting someone remote play villain
- letting villain be so much higher level it required 4 mages of higher level than them
- having villain liberally use counterspell (so much slow down)

Players:
- Richard?
- Guy
- Spike
- Florent
- April
- Shaun (remote)
