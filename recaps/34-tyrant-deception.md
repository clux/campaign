You complete the three outer rooms of the mirror world killing a tree.

Hjarka's dual is whispering. Celeste inspiration.
Cameron was getting consumed by the world.

Main room with Cameron also contains a Death Tyrant.

Highlight is a death tyrant disintegrate beam originally rolled for Mordai in response to a fireball, but he deception roll points it toward Hanir, who then in turn deception rolls it to Hjarka (only person who could survive it).

Post kill they plummet down into the inner cavern. Hjarka can now fly as she's getting close to the source of her divinity.

This was a Celeste redemption arc, but they banish Hjaka's dual instead, and they end up dismissing her entirely.
Hjarka actually turns more evil as a result of this.

They cross a indiana jones style invisible chasm with a name puzzle to get across. In a room on a pedestal is the deck of many things.
