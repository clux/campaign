12th of April

Door puzzle to start. They find the Apparatus of Kvalish in there.
They also find a lab with some potions and a small scrying stone, visions for mordai and hjarka.

Underwater passageway, leading into a three way split.
They choose the path with the a water dragon.

You fight it and cut out its heart. Meanwhile Hanir has the worst streak of wild magic seen so far.

Eventually, you reach a room with a large scrying stone, and a spectre of Umberlee.
Umberlee explains the source of her worship; control of the waves, safe passage (very poseidon).
She leads you to the Kraken (Slarkrathel) and invites you to feed it, which you do (with the dragon heart).

She also wants Hjarka to split the contintent by setting charges (via Wave) at three distinct locations.

Umberlee has history with Hanir (failed the rites before and stuck on the island). Hanir refuses to let go of found items (deck), so he pulls a card from it; Avatar of Death (which DM unknowingly buffs because he couldn't find hte stats for it).
It almost kills everyone (if it hadn't been for Hanir dying in the same round they triggered it).

Hanir death count: 2 (final)

Water bubble shoots them out of the temple and out of the mirror world.
