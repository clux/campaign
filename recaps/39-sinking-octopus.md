Command drop causes the pact weapon of Gwyn to drop. Just a hilt at that point, but Mordai takes it. They don't realize it's a pact weapon.

Persuade him to let them pass, and they venture down into the sinking ship. Treasure box found, but large octopus starts gripping ship and starts pulling it down.
Several rounds of increasing descent, Hjarka 20 religion roll summons Kraken and it fights off Octopus.

You fight snakes that have some CON save effect, but GW bites the snake back and tells it to make a CON save.

On the top, Gwyn is there. 3 warlock moon by rowboat.

GW is still down in the water with the treasure chest weighing him down. He swims very slowly upwards but hast lost orientation. Hjarka tries to shine light through, but a bad perception roll causes GW to perceive it as evil light and he swims away from it. He eventually washes up on an island with a lighthouse.

Gwyn does not want to go to the island, but they do find out he was using the tentacle altar.

### Old log
- Prayed to umberlee (20 WIS) to summon kraken to kill giant octopus. Gwyn upset he was not transported down.
- Gwyn has been reluctant in giving information, but he doesn't need to harm the party. He wants to get to Baldur's Gate to find another power point.
- Drunken party with warlocks (too drunk to remember).

Players:
