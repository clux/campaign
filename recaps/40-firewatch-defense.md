## 41 - defensive-night
Hjarka catches blue scale and hides down there. As the evening approaches, you learn that at night, the undead come up from the sea below.
Slowly piecing together the information of the Tameraut (painted by the blind priest Oloran under the influence, as a warning), you come to understand that the way the ship went down has something to do with the undead.
You brace for the long night and an attack from the undead.

Attack begins. Empowered fireball on first flank. More attacks. Slow retreat into the house. Pendle has trip wires and netting to attack from in the main room. Iz casts synaptic static and it is super effective.

Night ends. Flo finds a speak with animals helmet.
They also finds the cache upstairs that they missed last session.

Players:
- James
- Pendle
- Flo
- Jay
- Guy

## 42 - Reefer Seagul
They talk to Virgil and inhabitants for closure.
"We were always warned about swimming there. Orolan lost his son (fishing) to a monstrous acid breathing snake there, and put some magic around it. Not sure if it's still active now."
Find potions of water breathing and something to equalize the pressure under water.

They head to the reef, go in the tunnel entrance used by the Neothelid rather than the undiscovered tomb door.
The spiraling cavern is a dangerous proposition, single file, climbing, then sharp drops. They find a water cache, but half-way through the neothelid attacks.
Immovable rod helps a bit, but the passage itself gives. A long fight starts, GW gets swallowed.

In the end they get various pieces of food for the seagul. Liver, heart, anal plate (3 rolls).

Players:
- James
- Pendle
- Flo
- Jay
- Guy?

1st of August
## 43 - Shipnanigans
Seagull (Virgil) gets his liver and it tells you where the Tameraut sank.
They return to the Artemis where Gwyn is locked up. They interrogate him a bit. It's strange, Iz and Gwyn both want the same thing, but Gwyn is further along.

Pendle returns to the book.

Alcoholic peryton haggis tuffed in a shark stomach. Iz seduces the cook to steal the chefs magic (he does not have much magic, except ingredients (next episode)).
Iz has a GOO dream underwater.
