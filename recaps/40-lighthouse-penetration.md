META: April out for two of these on Firewatch isle. 3/4. She has bluescale during that process. Jay joins as Zed during.

2nd of July
## 40 - top-down-firewatch
Scrappy investigation session of the Island. Looks abandoned.
Giant peryton attacks in the beginning, GW misty steps up to it, but it just grabs him, kills him and flies away with him.
They JUST managed to get to him before he is dead dead (no more diamonds).

They keep assaulting the place TOP DOWN. Snakes upstairs (similar to the ones on the Emperor).
GW finds a fascinator that he clips onto his nightvision goggles.
Painting of the Tameraut below. Zed is a storm herald barbarian and dislikes the painting.
Kitchen recently used. Find hidden chamber hidden behind potato bin. Survivors in the basement.

Players:
- Jay
- April
- Flo
- Guy
