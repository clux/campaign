4X+1
Smiling one was Sansuri who offered them help
but told about mind control field preventing her from reaching up.
so they sent them on a suicide mission using Sansuri's customized Greater Alter Self.
=> They were Fire Giants:

- Jasvir (Guy)
- Elsiar (Jay)
- Mafas (James)

and they chad'd their way through gilgrin, busting their way up to the peak without saying a word.
There they met Zoltan, his body guard (dual shielded fire giant from volos) and the crystal.

End of the game they turtle both the enemies. Zoltan thrown off (but he has fire immunity), and body guard 300ft into the air (from flight).
