## 45 - Maerimydra
13th of August 2019

You venture into an ancient drow encampment from a malfunctioning portal at the bottom of the sea, half lodged between the bow of the Tameraut and the sea floor.
The place seems abandoned apart from a few ghosts.

One ghost Ssapriina talks to you about the city, normally situated at the Dalelands (miles inland), and that the city was consumed by a creature called Irae.
Everyone were consumed Irae. Her power is immense. She slaughtered the entire city. Her wand absorbed all the defensive magic as she unleashed .
She slaughtered the entire city. Then teleported it here, all under water. To hide something. I saw it with my own eyes. Hundreds of years ago I've been struck down here. Occasionally she returns. Fortifies the place up even more. You never know when she's truly here.

She is spoken about like she is a lich and that this is a very special fortified place for her. Mordai has suspisions of what this might mean.

At the top of the city is a castle, you tried breaching it, but the two Eye Golems proved too dangerous at the time. Iz and Mordai tempting fate at the ceiling with EB while they petrifying gaze shot upwards (they would have been dead if that hit and they fell to the ground).

Party plans on heading back to land and deal with giants, and letting Mordecai and crew deal with claiming the reward for the Emperor.
