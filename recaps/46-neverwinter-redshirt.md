20th of August 2019?

Loosened Gwyn who told them he was going to seek out his master via octopus ride.
Then teleported out.

Ship to NWN. 7 days.
Stayed with Madame Rosene in fine rooms.

Breakfast with beets under Jackques. 100 roll on alcohol percentage.
Mordecai let Zed have 2 days in NWN before leaving. "Give him some practice cutting things"
"But he comes with us."

Shopped:

- Constanze Amarn (halfling with goggles); Ioun Stone Intellect, misc (was going to send for a bag of tricks in waterdeep)
- Traded in the Frostbrand greatsword for an adamantine bonesaw (via dwarven madman temporarily)

Learned about [Neverdeath](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Neverdeath)

Talked to  [Galaeron](https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Galaeron_Nihmedu)
(Looks like the standard shadow adept - but with a big sword)

Told about insides of Castle Never. Aberrations, sealed down. No one had returned. Treasure.

He "persuaded" Raffolk (500gp deposit, otherwise 100gp a day)
Met Raffolk, late 20s involuntary member of the Greycloaks. To help (meatshield inside Castle Never)
Paid him 50gp to get a whole backpack of food and persuaded him amazingly well to come along.

He ran along to tell his wife of the good party and how this was (presumably) easy money.
"All for one and one for all"
