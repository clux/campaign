26th of September

You venture across the towering bridge across the spires of Castle Never.
Unease roams as large flying creatures can be sensed outside the clouds, and whenever near pools of water, voices are heard (followed by WIS saves, but no failures).
In the main spire, the path upstairs is blocked, but 50 stories down below ground, there are cracks in the walls. Across one of these rifts in the eart across to the main path you saw a Blue Slaad suddengly being ganked by 20 or so gnolls. Swiftly, you take an alternate route up and murder first the gnolls (all of them, one synaptic static), then the blue slaad.

(At the time, they are unaware it is slaads)

Venturing further right, they reach the gnoll hideout. Mordai fireballs a tent, but due to the noise, they have evacuated from that place. Only a baby gnoll killed (ok, temp hp). Find a pair of girallions (pets), but ignore them.

Main cavern finds a bunch of beefed up gnolls; flinds, fang of yeenoghu, Shooshuva pet fiend hound (actually worst creature there). Still, they kill them all.
A huge statue of yeenoghu also found (which Iz also tries to drink the juice of).
