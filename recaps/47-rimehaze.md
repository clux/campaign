Was betrayed by Ymir, monstrosity frost giant (everlasting one), but during the battle a giant with green runes backstabbed it. a white lady in robes also visible. Secret entrance as reward.

# 48 rimehaze inner
Big Mordai exploration session. Flew across. Saw the whole Giant great hall. Saw an Everlasting one. Saw a green giant wormtonguing him.
Then the familiar got shafted by a icy spear in 20B.

They proceeded to sneak right around 18. Cast silence and battle 3 Frost giants one by one after effective turtling. They are chonky bois, but tactics prevail.
Solid silence helped take out 3 frost giants 1 by 1 in silence. We used Hanir to necro shroud but this was a wild magic fail (dragonflies) + remorhaz egg.

Found a book detailing the legend of Grymin the giantslayer.
