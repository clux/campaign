3rd of October 2019

You identify the flail used by the Flind, and keep clearing out gnoll cave. You find a sleeping duergar; Thysdille from gracklstugh. Captured by the gnolls. Sent to retrieve a stolen dragon egg. You free him and he joins the party.

You venture to the left corridor. It's more regal and unspoilt, save for the slime building on the walls and floors, and the large footprints.
You fight more slaads. You find a tadpole chamber (and lightningify it), you interrogate a bunch of dead people (hints of pretty lady killed them).

Chess board room with tiles over acid. Raffolk gets tricked, runs into the ooze. Iz soul cages his soul!
Spell also tricks Thysdille in the end (he things the dragon egg is there in the middle). He got a lot of rolls, but ultimately failed all of them. Even the final check to hold on from below.

Find altar with what looks like a greycloak (hint; it's not).
