Zed scouts ahead and talks to "Igor" who has been there for 3 months.
He shows them the crusher (because they wanted to see it), but he ultimately leads them into a large chamber with many water pools.

Cue terrible backstab fight. Aboleth tentacles out of the pool while Death Slaad flies above casting spells.
Ultimately both Zed and Iz fail the aboleth's Enslave save, and start swimming down with it.

They try to swim after it, but it's too far, they try a spiralling passage going further down (lead to darklake in the underdark). Also not ideal.
They venture back and rest.

They squish things with the crusher. They find a box by selune, but nothing openable yet.
Mordai history remembers a god of goliaths'; the Ram Lord; [[kavaki]].

You try a whole lot of things with the statue, but ultimately the puzzle is "solved" by GW being enlarged, while having a large goat to help him pry out the statue. They bring it to the crusher and prime it with a rat. This has consequences.
