## Rimehaze clear out
Counter-suggestion by Hanir that caused them to avoid furthe giant run-ins. Then carefully looted the cavern in Rimehaze, triggered frost bomb chest (fast mist creeping out freezing Faey in place), found the two-way portal to the key-puzzle chamber (controlling the engine-room?).

They instead took elevator up to protectorate. Talked to a bunch of cloud giants.

## Protectorate
Talked to Arfius he mentioned he wasn't much use directing armies atm, but directed them to Gludom. Gludom tried to scry on Irae (drawing by mordai), but failed. Saw 3 creatures. Storm giant, creature with a trident, and a white lady.
Mentioned they might need to stock up on anti-giant supplies in Gilgrin vault. He has the key (but still hard to get in). 

Puzzle was half the episode before they ended up in Gilgrin. (Tryout listened in during this borinp part).
They solved diffie hellman key exchange.
