## Rimehaze
Counter-suggestion by Hanir. Then carefully looted the cavern in Rimehaze, triggered frost bomb chest (fast mist creeping out freezing Faey in place), found the two-way portal to the key-puzzle chamber (controlling the engine-room?).

## Protectorate
Talked to Arfius he mentioned he wasn't much use directing armies atm, but directed them to Gludom. Gludom tried to scry on Irae (drawing by mordai), but failed. Saw 3 creatures. Storm giant, creature with a trident, and a white lady.
Mentioned they might need to stock up on anti-giant supplies in Gilgrin vault. He has the key (but still hard to get in).
