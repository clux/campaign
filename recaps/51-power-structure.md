Now being able to open Selune's box, you get a ring of wishes (1 left).
You then promptly return to the top of the tower where you find a wizards chambers.

Later conversations confirms this to be Chorom's dwelling. An adult blue dragon.

At the peak lie Chorom's decaying dragon body. You skin it, and talk to a vulture for info. It's not very helpful.

Goatweaver digs into the marble stone at the spire around a large construction and finds a focal point for the (essentially Barad-dur) tower's twin spire.
At the focal point, lightning arcs out towards the spire, and there's a hidden climbing space down into the wizard's chambers.
The focal point functions as a scrying pool, and you all dig in, seeing visions of; a horse demon, a gnoll god, demogorgon with koa-toans.

You visit Raffolk's wife Claudia who's not happy. Kid is kept in the dark.

You also finally get an audience with Mordai, and he leads you into the mansion. He was seemingly not aware of Chorom's death, but he also tells you a lot of history. How the city was in high leagues with divinity (namely Selune and royalty), but he's also shifty. A painting in the room tracks your movement; and it's detected as trace undead.

You leave for now, and have Thobak create a +1 full plate out of adult blue dragon scales. He's not very comfortable with potentially working with Chorom's scales.

You summon Pugweaver to keep a watch outside the castle.
