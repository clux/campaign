## 53 felgolos
talked to a brass dragon, not initially keen on you
but you talked to it for a while in some moderately precarious circumstances
and you got it to open up.

the dragon felgolos was very old, and seemingly been in there for some time, apparently, at least initially; willingly, but since been magically sealed in
voluntary privacy + knowledge + forging
can forge / enhance weaponry

fire giants spread his seeds (while infreqently - protect them in early stages of life)
eggs unaccounted for, 2 years since lain, should've hatched by now, wants you to find them
wants you to find them before he breaches alarms out.

you found out Felgolos was alive during the time of Kiaransalee,
and the 4 champions that fought her in the netherese empire
and he suggested that Irae might be collecting sets of her relics to take her powers.

anyway you told him you'd try to remove the force field containing him, and meet him by the forge.

afterwards, you scoped out the north east area and triggered some protective magic that animated the statue. you sought refuge within the confines of an armory, but that did not prove sufficient.

the statue of the matriarch then revealed its true form and turned into blood golem with tensers transformation, undead minions spawned from the sarcophagi around it
however you were able to brute force it down and break its summoning cycle with a flying spell

found cooking recipe scroll (he threw it away)

- Divine Scourge needs a stone (moonstone)
- luskan what's Arklem's role (lich, loose cooperation with Irae)

54 Recap
The 3 of you went on a raiding mission into the vault of gilgrin (secure).
Therein, you found the hammer of grymin, various other high level weaponry, and also a brass dragon, Felgolos, who could shapeshift.
Partially, self-isolating, (fire giants ensure his children were spread wide while he had access to the spine, its forge, hobbies, reading), but recently he was actually imprisoned.
