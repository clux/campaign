53 - vault part 2
talked to a brass dragon, not initially keen on you
but you talked to it for a while in some moderately precarious circumstances
and you got it to open up.

the dragon felgolos was very old, and seemingly been in there for some time, apparently, at least initially; willingly, but since been magically sealed in
voluntary privacy + knowledge + forging
can forge / enhance weaponry

fire giants spread his seeds (while infreqently - protect them in early stages of life)
eggs unaccounted for, 2 years since lain, should've hatched by now, wants you to find them
wants you to find them before he breaches alarms out.

you found out Felgolos was alive during the time of Kiaransalee,
and the 4 champions that fought her in the netherese empire
and he suggested that Irae might be collecting sets of her relics to take her powers.

anyway you told him you'd try to remove the force field containing him, and meet him by the forge.

afterwards, you scoped out the north east area and triggered some protective magic that animated the statue. you sought refuge within the confines of an armory, but that did not prove sufficient.

the statue of the matriarch then revealed its true form and turned into blood golem with tensers transformation, undead minions spawned from the sarcophagi around it
however you were able to brute force it down and break its summoning cycle with a flying spell

found cooking recipe scroll (he threw it away)

54 vault 3
book inscription akkhan
moontone gem - lights up green (he can use it)
golden helm (of telepathy) with purple lens

spellbook of Gorym (wizard): [Life Transference, Ray of Enfeeblement, Fire Shield, Resilient Sphere, Wall of Force, Modify Memory]
just trying to make ends meet - decent paying position
has a mistress; Janet outside of Luskan (who's the wife of Beniago Kurth)
he's been doing it on eggs of large sea creatures (he knows a priest of slarkrathel)

mist form with 2 people in bag
passed by in steam cover (do not believe you were seen)

Felgy/El-golo will want to visit Waterdeep once he's freed to meet Laeral

suri + felgy in rimehaze - he tunneled through
Egg of Galadaeros is crystal in Luskan

Allustriel in Faeywild

Bonris knew Arklem's name why?
Sansuri Safe passage

CHECK:

- moonstone of kavaki IDENTIFY (kavaki.md)
- Divine Scourge needs a stone (moonstone)
- luskan what's Arklem's role (lich, loose cooperation with Irae)

55 Waterdeep with Hanir
He wakes up from a deep sleep coverd in dark dreams. Dreams of him being taken away.

Going to waterdeep to stop Irae from taking the blade of shadows. Artifact used for Kiarensalee's weapon that was stashed there. Felgolos told you about the 3 parts, 2 of which you believe is now in Irae's possession.

4 days of downtime before Demogorgon attacks.
They get to prep and learn magic.
Diana can help Mordai boost his chronomancy. That was the interesting part she learned bits of from Shario. She has two spells?
Ursula can help GW learn about Akkhan's burial, since she has the books of Shario. (Maybe she recognises his light?)
Faey/Pendle: Braegan + shops training.
Hanir can meet with Jarlaxle?
