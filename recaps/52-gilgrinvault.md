53 - vault part 2
talked to dragon, not initially keen on you
but you talked for a while in some moderately precarious circumstances
but it seemed in a bit of a predicament itself

dragon quite old been in there for some time, but willingly
voluntary privacy + knowledge + forging
can forge / enhance weaponry
fire giants spread his seeds (while infreqently)
eggs gone, 2 years since hatched, wants you to find them
wants you to find them before he breaches alarms out.

cooking recipe is the scroll (he threw it away)

drow statue of a matriarch, turned into blood golem with tensers transfomration
it summoned creatures - you fought and tried to stop it at the source
to no avail
however you were able to brute force it down and break its summoning cycle with a flying spell
