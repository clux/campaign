## Vault
where did they come from?

made a lot of rucous broke in got hammer from desecrated moradin statue
looted 3 powerful weapons in forge
walked along lava walkflow
got healing potions in disused
ended sandwiched between the iron golem and the copper dragon
took the statue of bahamut
learned about Akkhan
and took the book of ancient dragons (unread)


53 - vault part 2
talked to a brass dragon, not initially keen on you
but you talked to it for a while in some moderately precarious circumstances
and you got it to open up.

the dragon felgolos was very old, and seemingly been in there for some time, apparently, at least initially; willingly, but since been magically sealed in
voluntary privacy + knowledge + forging
can forge / enhance weaponry

fire giants spread his seeds (while infreqently - protect them in early stages of life)
eggs unaccounted for, 2 years since lain, should've hatched by now, wants you to find them
wants you to find them before he breaches alarms out.

you found out Felgolos was alive during the time of Kiaransalee,
and the 4 champions that fought her in the netherese empire
and he suggested that Irae might be collecting sets of her relics to take her powers.

anyway you told him you'd try to remove the force field containing him, and meet him by the forge.

afterwards, you scoped out the north east area and triggered some protective magic that animated the statue. you sought refuge within the confines of an armory, but that did not prove sufficient.

the statue of the matriarch then revealed its true form and turned into blood golem with tensers transformation, undead minions spawned from the sarcophagi around it
however you were able to brute force it down and break its summoning cycle with a flying spell

found cooking recipe scroll (he threw it away)

54 vault 3
book inscription akkhan
moontone gem - lights up green (he can use it)
golden helm (of telepathy) with purple lens
trance?

spellbook of Gorym (wizard): [Life Transference, Ray of Enfeeblement, Fire Shield, Resilient Sphere, Wall of Force, Modify Memory]
just trying to make ends meet - decent paying position
has a mistress; Janet outside of Luskan (who's the wife of Beniago Kurth)
he's been doing it on eggs of large sea creatures (he knows a priest of slarkrathel)

mist form with 2 people in bag
passed by in steam cover (do not believe you were seen)

Felgy/El-golo will want to visit Waterdeep once he's freed to meet Laeral

suri + felgy in rimehaze - he tunneled through
Egg of Galadaeros is crystal in Luskan

Allustriel in Faeywild

Bonris knew Arklem's name why?
Sansuri Safe passage

CHECK:
- book about gods named akkhan (kavaki.md)
- moonstone of kavaki IDENTIFY (kavaki.md)
- Divine Scourge needs a stone (moonstone)
- luskan what's Arklem's role (lich, loose cooperation with Irae)

TODO: waterdeep academy
TODO: magic shop
- Gael's Magical Emporium (low-end)
- Mage Guild's Suppliers
TODO: proficiency / book + skill

54 Recap
The 3 of you went on a raiding mission into the vault of gilgrin (secure).
Therein, you found the hammer of grymin, various other high level weaponry, and also a brass dragon, Felgolos, who could shapeshift.
Partially, self-isolating, (fire giants ensure his children were spread wide while he had access to the spine, its forge, hobbies, reading), but recently he was actually imprisoned.
Umnos.

55 Waterdeep with Hanir
He wakes up from a deep sleep coverd in dark dreams. Dreams of him being taken away.

He learn that whenever Mordai uses Chronomancy, there's a small surge of Wild magic. They can harness it to create combos (so he has an incentive to die?). Necrotic energy surged from your fingertips, and killed all the plants in Ailos's tree garden. But it also harmed you. As this happenend, you had strange twisting visions of seeing the gaping maw of a black beast drain the life out of you.
Mages kept him in isolation.

Hans wants to learn history of himself. It was Arklem who brainwashed him.

Going to waterdeep to stop Irae from taking the blade of shadows. Artifact used for Kiarensalee's weapon that was stashed there. Felgolos told you about the 3 parts, 2 of which you believe is now in Irae's possession.

4 days of downtime before Demogorgon attacks.
They get to prep and learn magic.
Diana can help Mordai boost his chronomancy. That was the interesting part she learned bits of from Shario. She has two spells?
Ursula can help GW learn about Akkhan's burial, since she has the books of Shario. (Maybe she recognises his light?)
Faey/Pendle: Braegan + shops training.
Hanir can meet with Jarlaxle?

## RECAP

- mordai: lotte chronomancy
- PRE-BATTLE GORGON: gaze at someone scrying at him

## RECAP PRE BATTLE
Arrived in Waterdeep by teleport. Felgolos takes a 4 day trip instead to avoid consequences of getting stuck in dragon defenses.

Talked to CPC Grey aware captain of the Pestillence, and did various shopping.
(Created Dragon Lance, but not the kavaki gem)

You've told Diana, the arch mage, about Irae and the 3 artifacts of Kiaransalee that she appears to be gathering, the last of which in Waterdeep. She went on scrying on the areas on the map where you believed the closest demon lords were.

Ursula started doing research on Kiaransalee and the Crones of Thanatos. And excitedly last night, she reported on having found information (heavily erased) on Sharia's burial chamber - at the foundation of Castle Waterdeep. However, just as this was happening, an earthquake struck the city.

HI FELGY, BTW THERE'S A DEMON LORD WERE ABOUT TO FIGHT. WE FOUND SHARIO'S TOMB.

BATTLE PLAN:
GW persuades 3 archers to stand on eastern wall
400 ft wall to wall
bow arrow from southern tower
holy weapon paladin (tons of radiant - simulate)
tons of fire spells when faey and gw smashes
archers (will fail unless they crit for 3 dmg)
beacon of hope (adv wisdom saves party)
oil of slipperyness (restrained/paralyzed immunity)
blade of shadow in mordai's bag
wall of stone around demo from mordai
fighters + madeiron flank center
gw in tower with archers (and wand of fireballs)
drink potion of fire immunity (felgy)
wail at it with spells, archers
then paladin and everyone gank
remember haste on GW

NB: Liches traditionally have spell immunity to level <=5 (globe invuln)
