Goatweaver learns of angrily breaking into Mordai's place, and she never came out, but was seen with glowing eyes instead.

You have a viking funeral for Zed. You all say some words, then fire. The arrows miss, but eldritch blast takes care of finalizing the ceremony.
You get the armor in 4 days.

You give Claudia's son Gilbert (now orphaned) some potatoes.
You visit the scrying sphere, and while it's not working, you do bribe a raven with some heart jerky. You learned Chorom was pinned down at night and an army of undead recently seemed to finish them off. Perhaps connected to the tight connections in the Shadowfell with this place.

You scry some more and see more things you shouldn't. Lolth. Mordecai drinking.
