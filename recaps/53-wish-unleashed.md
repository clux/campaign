Evil Mordai drags GW bleeding body out onto the floor. Taunts you and starts smiting GW.
They use Wish to remove the Force Cage, res GW and the tables quickly turn. He summons a Nihileth which absorbs Whelm and protects him.
Before he dies he exclaims:
"You cannot kill me, I am bound to Koth".

One violent corpse explosion later, only his skeleton remains. Nihileth also disapears, taking Whelm with him.
GW mauls undead Claudia and they check out everything.

A book of spells and rituals, and a map with circled demon lords.

- Two-faced baboon in the north (Demogorgon)
- Horned goat face in the west (Baphomet)
- Gnoll face above that (Yeenoghu)
- Crossed out skull with wings in the ocean (Orcus)
- Cross out puddle near underdark exit (Juiblex)

Two followers appear after the battle; Faeynore & Hans, a combo from the Feywild who's been on your tail for a while, and they've been in Blingdenstone after you.
You recap the events since you lost them. Like the last 30 episodes when they lost the tail at sea.

More information in books learned; Nihileth is an undead aboleth, the ritual in the red book produces a liquid to be drunk after a ritual, and page ends with an image of a skull with gemstone eyes.

Hans mass suggestions the guards so they can make off with the gold keeping the plutocracy afloat (15k GP).
The greycloak guards think they did all the work, and get promoted. Galeron takes over the city (though underfinanced now).
You hope Gilbert will be raised by the Greycloaks.

You finish off the year with a meal at Madame Rosene's and Goatweaver insists the blood soup does not require two hours of cooking.
A rare CON save failure causes a projectile vomit battle. Monk gets his first deflect (counts as a missle).

Your armor is ready.
