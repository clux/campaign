13th of January

Goatweaver arrives from "the scenic route". He paid 5 gold and crossed the bridge with Marge.
Rest of the party still outstanding on the really scenic route.

At the Tower Arcane, mean girl Sydney is there and does some condenscending trials of strength.
Badly favours AOE rather than single target damage. GW is shafted (but flirted with). Everyone gets at least apprentice status though (later receive discount cards).

They meet Celerum (a presumably low-powered wizard), but he's a penultimate rank under Arklem. He demonstrates the power of the Brotherhood, he has a scrying ball.
Goatweaver somehow pretends he is a wizard. Celerom lets you scry and see Yeenoghu. They also sense Conjuration energy from giants tower north of Mirabar, presumably the cause of the demon lords presence.

Banishment not trivial. Cannot scry upon the tower itself something is going on there. Scries also weakly confirm locations of other demon lords (through associate beasts).
Learn about Fracto-Nimbuli (storm giant ruler).

Goatweaver is upset about the lack of Whelm and asks for help, and learns a large fish-like creature under the earth has it.
Goatweaver is interrogated about his god and his motives. "Colors are important".
Celerom wants to test it, and morphs into a large red devil, and GW manages not to maul him in the anything.
Goatweaver talks philosophically about regret, motivation coming from dogs? It's hard to read. Ultimately he is the "blunt instrument of Kavaki".

You buy a bunch of spells and explore the relation between toenail sizes and strength potion power.

Players:
- Flo
- Guy
- James
- Jay?
