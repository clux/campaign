They clear out hill giant hotel (final part, set free a bunch of wolves, lots of wolf RP with an uneasy truth).
They also lure out the tainted one? (special hill giant in volos)
Hanir becomes the mayor of mirabar after rescuing the trapped villagers.

Battle with blood giant that nuked pendle. He would have been fine had Faeynore not taunted the feral hill giant.
mind control from Irae (they did not know at the time) on Hanir and he proceeded to Sunbeam on Pendle and Mordai.
They do finally clear it (but with great difficulty)
ends with a cloud giant smiling one sarcastically clapping
