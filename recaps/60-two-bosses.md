They killed Havil, destroyed his armor with the first grymin crit (with a hold monster combo). Took the fuckoff shield(?). Snuck around in the various places, found `Zavag`, an incarcerated slender giant monk who was looking to escape. You freed him in exchange for some information. Then you took down two sleeping giants with 3/4 grymin crits and silence. However, the last miss meant Mordai burned EBs to finish the last giant. This was outside the silence and heard. 2 giants (one next to the door), now stare you down, and shout; "the intruders, they are here" (in giant).
