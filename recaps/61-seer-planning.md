More questions for Berctha.

Hans's fate is convoluted, something is messing with it.
She does more clearly tell that at the top of the mountain; evil lives. "Stop the lich".
Irae T'sarran. 200 year old drow priestess.
Does not know about the place to confirm whether she was the one from the sea.
They return to Mithrendain and teleport to hill giant house.

Eventually meet up with Sansuri and Petros (did not planar travel). She talks about Neri a (former) ally storm giant. Talks about Markis Hyrksag (former) frost giant ally.

Protectorate is revealed to have manage lesser giants. They should seek them out. But first, they have to get past Rimehaze and the frost giants.

We do our first remote roll20 session. You fight 2 young frost dragons.
