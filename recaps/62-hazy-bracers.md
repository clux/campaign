# rimehaze & hyrkzag
Found ghost hyrkzag former Merkis to Jarl Storvald. Was betrayed by Ymir, monstrosity frost giant (everlasting one), but during the battle a giant with green runes backstabbed it. a white lady in robes also visible. Secret entrance as reward. Cheated it by using Chrono: Paradoxical Summons and summoned the arm band up front.
