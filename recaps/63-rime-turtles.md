# rimehaze battle
Found a book detailing the legend of Grymin the giantslayer.

Big Mordai exploration session. Flew across. Saw the whole Giant great hall. Saw an Everlasting one. Saw a green giant wormtonguing him.
Then the familiar got shafted by a icy spear in 20B.

They proceeded to sneak right around 18. Cast silence and battle 3 Frost giants one by one after effective turtling. They are chonky bois, but tactics prevail.
Solid silence helped take out 3 frost giants 1 by 1 in silence. We used Hanir to necro shroud but this was a wild magic fail (dragonflies) + remorhaz egg.

Opened the door in 18B. Saw the glowing crystal in the center (spine center point). Behind was Arazia. Void Giant CC187.
Big battle with her and mysterious figure cast spells in the background (flying invisibly). Chrono: Unstable Singularity activated. Delayed blast fireball bead on crystal.
First interaction with Irae. She did a dominate/charm as she dimensioned doored out (mass suggestion).

"you've caused enough trouble already. why don't you go back and talk to the frost giants.."
