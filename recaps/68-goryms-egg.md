## 68 gorym 19/05
The 3 of you went on a raiding mission into the vault of gilgrin (secure).
Therein, you found the hammer of grymin, various other high level weaponry, and also a brass dragon, Felgolos, who could shapeshift.
Partially, self-isolating, (fire giants ensure his children were spread wide while he had access to the spine, its forge, hobbies, reading), but recently he was actually imprisoned.

You learned that he had not had proper access to his recent brood (3 eggs). Laying eggs for him is an incredibly rare event, and he was promised the utmost protection.
With this taken away, and you mentioning the other dragon eggs you've seen, he's not happy, and asked you kindly to check on the dragon nursery underneath Gilgrin.

You did so, using a combination of gaseous form and bag of holding, sneaking past Zoltan and several fire giants. Down a spiraling stair case underneath one tower, you found a wizard Gorym, periodically lowering the eggs into hot lava, coating it; performing some kind of magical ritual with the eggs as the main source.

You overpowered him, and drag him back with a bag of holding.
He has a spellbook (wizard): [Life Transference, Ray of Enfeeblement, Fire Shield, Resilient Sphere, Wall of Force, Modify Memory]

just trying to make ends meet - decent paying position
has a mistress; Janet outside of Luskan (who's the wife of Beniago Kurth)
he's been doing it on eggs of large sea creatures (he knows a priest of slarkrathel)

TL;DR south end explored to try to free felgolos, then returning egg from outside.

You returned Gorym over to Felgolos, who eventually kills him. Then you work on freeing Felgolos, destroying a magical device known as a Mytholabe, that maintained the arcana necessary to keep Felgolos locked up.

In the process of looking through the lower right area of Gilgrin's vault, you found a book inscribed by Akkhan, and a moontone gem that lights up for GW.

You mount the dragon, and fly up through the elevator shaft to the Protectorate. Sharp words are exchanged, Felgolos almost takes out Gludom, but they eventually reach an understanding. You scry on Luskan, and find the Egg of Galadaeros to be gone.

With potentially 2/3 artifacts for Kiaransalee's Scythe recently stolen, you head for Waterdeep to protect the blade, wherever it may lie buried.

Extra notes; Sansuri would be granted safe passage to Rimehaze.
