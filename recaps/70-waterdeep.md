## 70 Hanir Awakens 02/06
(Birthday dnd. I resigned that week.)

Hanir wakes up from a deep sleep with dark dreams in the protectorate. Dreams of him being taken away.

He learn that whenever Mordai uses Chronomancy, there's a small surge of Wild magic. They can harness it to create combos (so he has an incentive to die?). Necrotic energy surged from your fingertips, and killed all the plants in Ailos's tree garden. But it also harmed you. As this happenend, you had strange twisting visions of seeing the gaping maw of a black beast drain the life out of you.
Mages kept him in isolation.

Hans wants to learn history of himself. It was Arklem who brainwashed him.

Going to waterdeep to stop Irae from taking the blade of shadows. Artifact used for Kiarensalee's weapon that was stashed there. Felgolos told you about the 3 parts, 2 of which you believe is now in Irae's possession.

4 days of downtime before Demogorgon attacks.
They get to prep and learn magic.
Diana can help Mordai boost his chronomancy. That was the interesting part she learned bits of from Shario. She has two spells?
Ursula can help GW learn about Akkhan's burial, since she has the books of Shario. (Maybe she recognises his light?)
Faey/Pendle: Braegan + shops training.
Hanir can meet with Jarlaxle?
