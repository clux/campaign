## 71 Preparing for Battle 09/06
Arrived in Waterdeep by teleport. Felgolos takes a 4 day trip instead to avoid consequences of getting stuck in dragon defenses.

Talked to CPC Grey aware captain of the Pestillence, and did various shopping.
(Created Dragon Lance, but not the kavaki gem)

You've told Diana, the arch mage, about Irae and the 3 artifacts of Kiaransalee that she appears to be gathering, the last of which in Waterdeep. She went on scrying on the areas on the map where you believed the closest demon lords were.

Ursula started doing research on Kiaransalee and the Crones of Thanatos. And excitedly last night, she reported on having found information (heavily erased) on Sharia's burial chamber - at the foundation of Castle Waterdeep. However, just as this was happening, an earthquake struck the city.

HI FELGY, BTW THERE'S A DEMON LORD WERE ABOUT TO FIGHT. WE FOUND SHARIO'S TOMB.
