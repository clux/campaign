Ended up meeting Havil and Serissa. Serissa ports out. They kill Havil.
They killed Havil, destroyed his armor with the first grymin crit (with a hold monster combo).

After this, you try to find some place to rest, through some aggressive use of wall teleportation (chrono spell not intended for it), and you avoid the search squad after.

Snuck around in the various places, found `Zavag`, an incarcerated slender giant monk who was looking to escape. You freed him in exchange for some information.

You proceed to murde a sleeping storm giant guarding a heavily fortified entrance (Reliquary), and paint "YOU'RE NEXT - GREEMIN" with his blood.
Intimidation is an unusual tactic against the strongest of giants, but you are clearly well-armed.
The last sleeping storm giant inside the center facility was also murderised. 3/4 Grymin crits suceeded this episode.

However, the last miss meant Mordai burned EBs to finish the last giant.
This was outside the silence and heard. 2 giants (one next to the door), now stare you down, and shout; "the intruders, they are here" (in giant).
