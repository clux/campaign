The storm giants calling for backup returned with friends. 5 giants cause a rough fight, you've never encountered more than two giants at a time before. It's a good thing you had all this lightning resistance.

On the corpses you found information on the queens of this place Neri and Serissa. Both of which have their own keys to the two distinct doors to the reliquary.

You also loot a dormitory up north and find a potion of storm giant strength, a superior healing potion, and a notebook.
Notebook mentions a floating mage visited 5 somethings ago. Also mentions much gold in reliquary.

Bran's chest had a Robe of useful items.
