You grab Umnos's loot and climb the tree at the summit of Halos up to Ysgard.

You met a goliath lady (Orena) who guided you to Kavaki's hut in Gladsheim.
He's a simple god with simple ideals, and a simple portfolio.

He rewards GW for his actions, but asks that he does better marketing so that the people he does not maul can tell the tale.
After some brain storming, the Divine Scourge flail now has KA/VA/KI forged onto the three flail heads.

Titania grants Faey his Lord of Shadows title, and elevates him to an Arch-fey.

Mordai offered opportunity to change his warlock patron to Kavaki, under the Simple Domain.

You also take the infinite staircase across to the temple of Selune, who has a gauntlet set up for you.

To end the episode, the egg is dispelled, still intact. Left with Gludom along with the Hammer of Grymin. Now hopefully obsolete.
