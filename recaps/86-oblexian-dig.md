Oblexian Dig
10th Nov 2020

You had a long discussiong thinking about what to do after your big forceful interraction with [[zaehesh]].
While she is infernal, she presented a case against the unnatural, and anomalous undead.
Celerum, while also presenting a resonable case, does seem more suss to you. Why is he working with this type of magic? How does this magic actually work? If the undead have souls, then surely this is pretty powerful magic?

You get on decent grounds with Zaehesh afterwards and she's agreed to wait with any further attacks on Bone City.

You plan instead on using Goatweavers's plant travelling ability to head to Luskan (old luskan), and investigate what exactly happened there, to cross-reference Celerum's story.

You also had a brief excursion down in the dungeons of Nekrina that was barricaded off. Below you found some underdarkian creatures trying to trick you into a bad situation, but you were having none of it.

After some investigation, you did come across a book about the disappearance of Maerimydra, a city tied to Irae, east of Mirabar (in underdark terms). You also saw a pamphlet about Akkhan and the diamond mines he was buried in (Boreal Valley).

So after a good long rest, and one final cast of Flight/Fly? GW's wings extend fully as he's walking. Takes some getting used to it being muscle control.
