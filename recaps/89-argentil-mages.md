Argentil Mages
1st Dec 2020

You barely scaped by in the last three rounds of the gauntlet on Argentil Peak.

You dispatched an extremely easy beginning challenge with a stone golem, chimeras and unicorns healing up.

But then went on to face two 18th level spell casters - champions of Mystra - doing a prismatic wall and blade of disaster combo (both 9th level spells). Essentially setting up a melee fortification that actually got GW down, albeit barely. The remaining lions almost took down Mordai who got down to 1hp, and Faey had to make the choice of healing the dying GW on the ground, or Mordai with 1hp.

Due to some lucky misses from the crystal minotaurs, GW survives long enough to fly away and heal, while the Faey/Mordai dispatches the Lions. Then, after cleaning up the rest from a distance, Alustriel steps out of the prismatic wall, telling you "it's been an honor fighting you", then have the blade of disaster finish herself off.

Finally, in the Collosseum of Laceration, you met three champions; Mordenkainen, the barbarian Wulfgar, and the champion of Selune; Celeste.
All three dealing huge damage right from the getgo, well, everyone except Wulfgar anyway, because GW got in his face before he started raging and took out 160HP in one round.

Meteor Swarm + Abu Dalzim + Celeste's immense ~60DMG per hit was too much for Mordai who died and got auto-critted there, so it got down to 2v2. Mordenkainen and Faey battled, with a few stuns and an almost deflected Finger of Death, eventually GW came and finished him off after he had dished out a significant amount of damage.
Celeste unfortunately kept GW occupied too long with a well placed drop Command, and got time to deal more damage to Faey, which ultimately caused Faey to go down.
In the end, two exhausted heroes, Celeste and GW battle 1v1 with almost no health left. She misses both her last attacks. Blur/+2Plate is too strong.
