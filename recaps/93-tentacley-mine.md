Tentacley Mine
19th Jan 2021

You headed into the Boreal Mine after having gotten its location from the Old Witch.
A frozen over mine with apparently no survivors.

Ghosts were there aplenty, but all had lost their minds and speaking only a few lines here and then. The lines indicated some humiliating event, and vengeful thoughts, and something about making people forget. You did not make any sense out of it.

You found a strange drilling apparatus, among a library of books. The main one; Fire and Lies by Grymin Wordbraids, taken by Goatweaver (not read).

After this you checked the place thoroughly, found icy passages, single file mining tunnels, a huge bore worm protecting one particular passage.

Bailing out of that one, you instead went for the single-file mining passages, where you were rudely greeted by a Urochar, a slithering aberration with four 30ft long tentacles grappling you and locking you down with its paralyzing gaze.

It was a chaotic fight with very little line of sight, ending in Feay being knocked down, but you got the better of the creature in the end.

After which, you found one of these mining tunnels lead into the backside of a sarcophagus, and you quickly replace the dead dwarf therein, with your old bodies; one by one, pulling your way through the dead dwarfs abode.

On the other side; a personalised room with a painting of the 4 sunset warriors; Natalya, Sunwuko, Sharia, and Akkhan, along with belonings personal to Akkhan.

Finally, where we left off; a large ceremonial chamber; an armored dwarf lying atop an altar in a room; and a strange androgynous humanoid floating in the air with bandages wrapped around its body.
