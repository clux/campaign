Past Akkhan
2nd Feb 2021

You dug up diamonds after turning a defensive bore worm into an offensive drilling machine.

Using a diamond for empowerment, you gazed backwards through 500 years, and saw, what you believe was `Arklem`, the Grand Archmage of the Arcane Brotherhood, going into the Boreal Mine under questionable pretenses; to erase the past for the dwarves. Turns out to him, that meant, erasing everyone who remembered, and then raising `Akkhan` as, presumably his own slave.

The ritual did not look like it went completely after the plan. Akkhan fought and broke the focus crystal used to raise him, and caused him to be abandoned in the place for the past 500 years as a Death Knight.

You saw the place warded to death, you saw a celestial Deva easily controlled and converted to a Witch, by the arch mage, who you then saw leave the mine.

After tied up various loose ends following this; read books about the history of the place and the frostbeards, sending messages to Felgolos (however, it seemed to be blocked), went back to the Witch of Farron peak, delivered Akkhan's crossbow, and tried to get more information out of it through extensive bartering with items.

Having a small amount of luck, she did reveal some information about something Arklem mentioned, 'the helix' which apparently was not supposed to find them there. Not much was learned, but she did say it is a very secretive organisation, but not much else. Something cryptic about it possibly being tied to something metallic.

After that, you went back to the frost giants and plotted with Suri about a possible plan to take on Yeenaghu, the prince of gnolls, the destroyer of Luskan. Having filled up on what little supplies were available, gnoll slayer arrows, one potion of speed, you tracked some gnolls killing a snowy owlbear.

While you hovered above, a seemingly uncaring figure, went on their slow path northwards while the gnolls tried the same attack on the cloaked figure. This turned out to be a bad choice of target, as it quickly released two arrows to the gnolls in the back, and just staring down the last, which during its escape, then got eagle sniped by Faey above.

As your eyes meet that of an elven figure below. April, would you describe your character please.
