Helical Beginnings
9th Feb 2021

You met `Andraste`, a wood elf from Cormanthor on her way up north to talk to her aide `Adalon`.

After exchanging cautious pleasantries, and a failed attempt from Goatweaver to try to sell the newcomer on the religion of Kavaki, you realised that you had some common goals, particularly in getting rid of the gnoll infestation moving erratically around the Boreal Valley, but also in the form of information from both her aide.

You griffined your way to Icewind Dale where you met `Adalon`, clearly some kind of leader figure for the tight-nit town, but also clearly knowing a lot more than a leader from a hunter/fishing village should know.

While not willing to divulge all the information to the self-proclaimed "Kavaki Task Force", he did tell you about the intel he had on its whereabouts (though turned out just the same information you had from the Frost Giants from insiders), and that he seemed very much aligned with getting rid of gnolls.

Still, despite a racuous winter festival culminating in a heroes feast made out of knucklehead trouts. You can't shake the feeling that someone knows more than they let on.

The morning after, using your griffins and hoping your heroes feast last long enough, you made your way down the gnoll tunnel / purple worm tunnel, set up alarms, and made your way down, to deal with the gnolls; and you did not intend to hide any gnoll corpses.

THEY HAVE CLOUDKILL AS A PLAN.
THEY HAVE HEROES FEAST.
ALARM BEHIND THEM
