Roll artifact. Flail of Yeenoghu.

Maerimydra good. (THEY WANT TO GO THERE)
Irithyll, no good ideas.
Helix? Enough reasons to seek them.
Go back to Adalon? Is he related?
He wasn't too keen to share info.
But maybe he'll share more now that they've killed yeenoghu.
He needs a clear lead otherwise they are probably going to:
- Maerimydra

Icewind Dale first!

Players:
- Florent
- Guy
- Jay
