Brass Banking
02 Mar 2021

You went to the City of Brass and met with Dhaikhezzish, a ruler of immense power within the city, who gave you his time after you flashed your helical ring, and giving him `The Butcher` (the flail of Yeenoghu) as an offering.

He agreed to let you target scry from the Spire at Long Castle, provided you partake in the `Onyx Octagon`, a gladiator style arena, gearing up for three fights in the next three days; the twin sisters tomorrow, the champion Rak the day after, and you vs. the champion on the third day.

He also would give you `Extinction`, if you could beat his champion in the Octagon.

With financial plans set, you got an account with the Grand Obsidian, a banking branch run by devils/efreeti/and who knows who else. You have their base subscription that grants you a teleporting deposit ring that lets you teleport gold into it at will.

You also sold the majority of your magic items to cash out somewhere in the range of 150k gold (what necessitates a bank), then you used a commensurate amount on items taded to the Plane of Fire;

- Book of Exalted Deeds 80k
- Blackrazor for Oathkeeper (50k sword for 50k maul)
- Staff of Power
- Stormbow upgrades for Faey

With the shopping episode out of the way, you make your way to the arena to see what is going on, now that you are clearly here for a few days.

Need: Make Oathkeeper, tweak Stormbow (LG, +3), Tweak Book to remove attunement (he uses it)
TODO: make Grand Obsidian basic subscription ring.
TODO: roll artifacts (extinction + maul + book) https://5e.tools/items.html
