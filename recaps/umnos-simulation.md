## Fracto; AC21
+18 to hit. 2d6+13 (or 16 rage) base necro, bonus lg (ignoring re-roll, likely disadv against GW), crits 5d6 necro base.
=> 20 per hit expected with lg res
2 attack. Sentinel while riding.
LOTS OF HP IF HE CONSUMES FRYGGT 257+(162..504)
Leg 1: Riposte reaction attack. Add superiority dice to dmg.
Leg 1: Sweeping strike; hit another within reach
Leg 1: Thunderwave 2d8 thunder on CON save 20
Leg 1: Pushing attack; 15ft on STR save fail DC24 - 2d8 bludgeoning.

E(DMG) = 80 (2 attacks per round), 120 (3 attacks per round)
Should always get three attacks with sweeping / riposte (leg action) (or haste). Haste cancels out slow except for one less leg action.
If he's slowed he can only do one leg action + one push
B(BUFFED) = 23*4*2 = 184  (96 p round with haste, 2 leg actions)


## Fryggt; AC20
+14 to hit.
1x Bite 15ft 2d10+8 pierce + 2d8 cold
2x Claw 10ft: 2d6+8 slashing

(Leg 2) Wing+FLY: 15ft radius DC22 DEX save vs 2d6+8 bludgioning or PRONE.
Breath; recharge 5/6; 90ft cone DC22 CON vs 16d8 cold dmg. Half on success.
Pointless fear (do it at start, onions and garlic).
NOTE: 72 two one or TWO creatures (hiffee) on breath
USE BREATH OFTEN. IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE RESIST.

(EXPECT TO BE SLOWED)
=> 1 less claw, 1 less leg action => -(2d8+8 +2d6+8 bonus), -2AC
=> DEX SAVE DISADV.

=> E(DMG) = 128 slowed melee, 196 unslowed melee
NB: More if breath hits more than one. Otherwise breath is roughtly equal.
Breath worse if they CON SAVE 22.


## Hiffee - Valkyrie; 19AC
+7 Longbow 1d7+7 dmg two attacks (23 per round on hit, 15 after AC)
Healing touch; 20 healing on point, plus cure things.

100 DMG WHEN CRITTING if failing CON20 (1/3 on fracto)
Healing pool; 116 HP + 70 HP lay on hands + 10d4+20 Supreme + 8d4+8 superior

holy weapon for one round (likely max last two conc) => 3x2d8*2 dmg
=> E(DMG) = 60*2+50 = 200
(but decreasing after holy weap)
=> E_late(DMG) = 150

## Faey; 21 AC
Hasted => 21 AC
bow: 1d8+13 => 36 pr (+half of slaying; 3d10) (10d8 stormbow)
sneak: d6 pr => 4
stinger => 1d8+13 +d6 frostjade (x2 haste) => 44pr
unarmed => 1d8+7 (x2 on bonus) => 24pr

Pretty consistent dmg when not healing

=> E_late(DMG) = 3*32 = 96

## DEUS EX: Sansuri
Smiling one. Take focus for a turn or two.


## ROUGH CALCULATION;
Party; can do 500dmg in 2 rounds, but reliably 300
Enemies; with dragon, expect 200 in two rounds.

Dragon can go down in 2/3 rounds. At which point 300dmg dealt.
Try to limit Umnos to 100 per round. TODO: maybe scale weapon to have some LG.

Party has: 300 HP. Can heal about 100 per round at the cost of not damaging.
