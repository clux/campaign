## Location
- Spellbook well hidden in Sphinx past lair in [[grundsgryn]]
- Spell components found in [[irithyll-oubliette]] in netherese ruins
- Spell casting improvement in [[arklem]]'s book.

## Spells
Modified from above inspirations;

- **Fasttrack** 2* (action, 60ft, VSM, conc, 60ft double speed line (movement only))
- **Delay Pain** 3* (reaction (after b4dmg num), self, VSM, conc, delay dmg while conc.
- **Rending Distortion** 4 (action, 120ft VS, 8d10 slashing on CON fail/half on save)
- **Alacrity** 1 (action, 60ft, VS, 10ft movement boost on creature)
- **Iterate** 1 (action, 60ft, VSM, give adv on attack for a creature)
- **Pause** 0 (bonus action, 60ft, VS, 1min, allows a creature to not make death saves and freeze it (if not hit))
worse than spare the dying? no, ranged! buffed to not be concentration
- **Suppress Reaction** 2 (action, 30ft, VSM, INT save or fall to bottom of initialtive order, repeat save eoT)
- **Unstable Singularity** 6 (action, 30ft sphere, VSM, pull4d12 vs STR (if centered), explosion next round 12d10 vs CON)

TODO: BUFF worse than EB and they might not take the damage
- **Temporary Wound** 0 (action, 30ft, VS, conc, CON save vs 1d12 temp necrotic dmg – regained end if >0)
- **Recursive Knowledge** 2 (1 action, self VS 1min, next INT save adv)
- **Quicken thought** 5 (action, self, VSM, conc, adv INT+DEX checks, diadv CHA checks, end 15CONvs.exha)
- **Skew Time** 0 (action, 30ft, VS, 5ft cube becomes difficult terrain, and disadv on 1stattack therein)
- **Time Warp** 4 (action 60ft, VS, conc, 20ft sphere, slow (3) inside + half mov + moveable) ^
- **Way Point** 9 – 5000gp stake (1hr, 30ft, return within 24h to point in space + time)
- **Time Trot** 3 (action, self, conc, when dashing: water walk+no opportunity+ ignore diff terr)
- **Backwards Gaze** 4 (ritual, self 1hr, peer into past as ethereal <100yrs ago, blind/deaf in present)
- **Astral Ejection** - (essences+void/time) 1hr cast – DID NOT HAVE TO DO THIS
- **Indefinite Preservation** 8: as with sphinx. Cha save twice. Petrified, but unaffectable 1d10days
- **Paradoxical Summons** 5; a 500gp item from future; needs to be returned to cast again
- Skipped **timewalk** because it was just Backwards Gaze with longer year.
- Skipped **Discern History** for now. Object identification with too much info given...
- Skipped **dampen movement** (made Time Warp instead to have full Slow effect)
- **Minor Timepass** 0 (prestidigitation style cantrip; 5ft cube, inorganic object not on someone ages)
- Skipped **Paradigm Shift** 2 (swap initiative order (unwilling int save to avoid) - too specific)
- Skipped **Stunt Reaction** 1 (action, 30ft, VSM conc, limited slow – too powerful vs bosses)
- **Space Anchor** 2 (action, touch VSM conc1rnd, involuntary short teleport)
- **Defabricate** 2 (bonus, range30, 5ft cube, VS, temporary disintegrate non-magic items)
- **Pull** 2 (action, range 60, VS, pull one creature up to 20ft towards pt in range. CON save)
- **Surge** 6 (action, 60ft, VS, pull creatures within 30ft towards center – 2 rounds!)
- **Flux** 4 (action, 60ftrange 20ft area, pull 30ft up in air, fall next rnd, Con save)

Second iteration spells (all sketchy, all mostly homebrew);

- **Existential Paradox** 8 (action, range 30, VS, WIS save); conciousness thrown back in time (shock) 20d10 psychic.
- **Guided Strikes** 4 (action, VS, conc 1min, 30ft) target crits on anything above natural 15 for attack rolls.
- **Haste Halo** 4 (action, VS, 30ft) halo of energy flashes outwards, within gains haste effects until the end of your next round

last two remove player agency and make it all about the tank, so maybe not..
maybe require them to be ranged?

Third iteration
- **Temporal Reversion** 4 (action, touch, VS): Turn back HP time on creature. 7d4+MOD HP
- **Permanency** 9 (1min, self) Make a spell of 4th level or lower (ctime <1min) permanent.


### Mine
- **Overcharge** 5 (conc, self, VS); Allow casting two action spells (of same or lower level) while concentrating (plus potentially cantrip as bonus action). Take 2d6 lightning dmg at end of each round.
Haste for wizards (but limiting concentration). My idea
- **Bifurcate** 5 (conc, self, VS); concentrates on two spells of equal or lower level. Disadvantage on concentration checks.

- TODO: a spell new that works a bit like witch bolt, but higher DMG

### Notes to self
- Fasttrack was 4 ,boosted
- Delaypain was 4, boosted (removed mat comp)
- Skew time nerfed (1attk only)
- Quicken thought was 6, boosted
- Time warp is new very good at 4, might need 5
- Boosted DMG of Unstable Sing
- Boosted DMG of Rending Distortion
- Reduced cast time of Pause + removed concentration
- Temporal Reversion level decreased

- Guided Strikes taken from Convergent Strike (which was way to powerful at high level)

## Chronomancy End Mordai
Based on events in [[grundsgryn]], [[mordai]] knows how to use Chronomancy.
He has received help to do so, but ultimately might deal with the [[dahaka]].
