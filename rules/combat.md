## Combat ideas

## Use Roles
(Via Matt Colville)
- infantry – novice positioning tools (physical blocks)
- glass cannons – high dmg people protected by infantry
- brute – low mobility, high damage, low ac, high hp
- artillery – behind the infantry making hard to get – advanced positioning tools
- boss – multiple of these together (needs reactions) - lynchpin

where:
- ranged bosses needs to be further away from enemies > 45ft away.
- Brute bosses could spawn closely.
- Use cover better for artillery (split move)
- Infantry 15ft apart – small gap with no attack of opp. 10ft both can take!

## Remind players to retreat
Even if: it’s never fun, but someone has to take leadership and decide to retreat.

## Use Believable Villain Personalities
Narcissism
Pride + grandiosity + egotism + lack of empathy

Psychopathy
Manipulation/exploitation of others, cynical disregard for morality. Focus on self-interest and deception.

Machiavellianism
Antisocial behaviour + impulsivity, selfishness, callousness, remorselessness.

### Specifics
#### Sadism
#### Loneliness
When no one around you wants to relate / can’t understand / unwilling to study X.

> “It’s seclusive, isolating, and wholly depressing. It’s a downward spiral that sucks you in the longer you keep the behaviour, succumbing inevitably to its grasp unless you find the increasingly rare person who will match your speed / drive / interests. We corner ourselves off, growing less comfortable with things outside a shrinking sphere of influence, fully aware that it’s all our own doing, but incapable of stopping it.”

Arguably madness form this can be attributed to Xanathar with Sylgar.

#### Unattached replaceability
Extreme views of transience. Use people while they are there. Nihilistic views. Emotions are just a physical response.

> “You humans are so concerned with emotions. If you could experience what it feels to be “ASCENDED” / harness the power of X, you would see your priorities shift very quickly.

Can be attributed to most “harvesting” type of villains.
