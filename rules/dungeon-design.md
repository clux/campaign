# Dungeon Design
Interesting notes on dungeon design.

Not how to run [[combat]], nor the generation of [[maps]], but the societies and systems behind a dungeon and how they form an organic ecosystem on its own that changes based on players actions.

## Active vs. Passive Dungeon
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/fusz92/the_active_dungeon_vs_the_passive_dungeon/
Both styles require contrivances. Active => more tactics. Passive => more exploration, puzzles, slow smarts.
TL;DR: neither style incorrect, just be aware of the tradoffs.
### Passive Dungeon
Majority of dungeons. Locations to be explored, and have enemies. Avoid obstacles, disarm traps. Passive means the dungeon is peaceful and devoid of combat; exists in state largely agnostic to the party's presence. E.g. raiding necro's long dead crypt.
Traps may exist, or might have been sprung already. Dungeon has no ways to respond aside from existing enemies.

#### Pros:
- Can help create a sense of ‘deep history’ through forgotten ruins and ancient structures
- Extremely flexible in terms of accommodating a variety of challenges
- Can exist agnostic of faction politics
- Familiar (and by extension comfortable) to many players
#### Cons:
- Often require contrivances to justify puzzles
- Seldom change the political landscape of a campaign once cleared (compared to something like clearing a town of an occupying army)
- Goals can become repetitive (i.e. an endless string of ‘go here, retrieve this treasure’)

### Active
Actively responding to players. E.g. raiding necro castle in n-day military raid ops. Necromancer actively trying to oppose the party by throwing enemies at them and creating obstacles to impede or prevent progress.
Doors rigged on the fly, water sources poisoned, staircases destroyed after before them, monsters actively wait for party to rest.
Arms race to secure rest locations. Tactical game, moves, countermoves.

#### Pros:
- Provide out-of-combat strategic opportunities a layer above in-combat tactics
- The gameplay loop of moves and countermoves is generally satisfying
- Can have a strong sense of progression as earlier parts of the dungeon are made safer
- Generate satisfying conclusions as the party wins a war of attrition

#### Cons:
- Can become a slog
- Leave little room for things like puzzles and riddles, which many players enjoy
- Combat-heavy and may have little variety as a result
- Require contrivances of intelligent enemies being holed-up in a location in order to function

## Holistic Dungeon
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/fbbj2f/building_better_dungeons_using_puzzle_game_design/

### Tier 1 Dungeon
My-first-dungeon. A bunch of thematically-disconnected rooms where puzzles exist in a vacuum and enemies are all but randomised. In one room you fight skeletons, in the next you fight drow, in the next you fight a yeti. There is no overarching theme tying the dungeon together, and possibly no deeper a goal than ‘get to the last room to grab the loot there’. This is where many DMs start out. There’s nothing wrong with it, but it’s important to recognise it as the entry-level stepping stone that it is.

### Tier 2 Dungeon
Tier 2 – The nine-to-five dungeon. This baby is a real workhorse in Dungeons & Dragons. There is a thematic tie that informs the puzzles and enemy encounters. Perhaps you are clearing kobolds out of an old forgeworks so that it can resume operation. The fights are against kobolds, the traps and puzzles are mechanisms built by the kobolds to keep intruders out, and maybe the final fight is a group of fanatical kobolds protecting a dragon egg and trying to warm it in the heart of the forge. This is the tier that 90% of all dungeons fall into, including those in published adventures. I want to be clear, this is not bad design. In fact it’s really good design. It’s immersive, satisfying and ultimately creates a positive gameplay experience.

### Tier 3 Dungeon
Tier 3 – The Holistic Dungeon. The dungeon is fundamentally defined by a theme or mechanic, and every facet of the dungeon ties back to this theme or mechanic. Everything from the way encounters must be approached to the integration of puzzles and how they must be solved. The Tucker’s Kobolds dungeon is a classic example of the Holistic Dungeon, wherein an entire philosophical approach to building and running encounters defines everything that takes place in the dungeon. It is also not the only form of implementation of the Holistic Dungeon, and my aim here is to discuss one of the other major ways to approach building the Holistic Dungeon.

### Holistic Goals
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/fbbj2f/building_better_dungeons_using_puzzle_game_design/
#### Have One Underlying Mechanic
E.g. the portal gun. The time travel mechanic of DOTT. Doom's flashlight.
Tie everything to the mechanic.
Puzzles do not exist in a vacuum.
Puzzles can change the world around them (rotational puzzles, lantern illumination, lever far below everything).
Try to Increase Complexity By Expanding On Your Mechanic, Not By Adding New Mechanics:
- Find new ways to use the same mechanic
- Combine different challenges so they occur simultaneously.
- If all else fails, add more rules to your core mechanic (can frustrate players!)
Introduce elements that complement your mechanic!
Build a mechanic suitable to the scope of your dungeon.

## Megadungeon
How to run a 100-room dungeon. Settlements, entrance points, expectations.
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/i4s06k/building_better_campaigns_using_puzzle_game/

### Gates
Gate entrance between reginos:
- political actions needed with factions to allow progression (political obstacles)
- party needs to reform
- fractured landscapes from natural disasters, liquefied earth (physical obstacles)
- guards disallow entry (combat / political obstacles)
- a __Fly__ scroll can be used for _semi gated_ progression
- item unlocks that allows certain destruction (obstacles / guards) or manipulation (ancient keys)
- financial obstacles

### Linearity
Allow non-linearity (if you want). Can be done by having many gates. One _might_ might help with another.
Consider what are HUB worlds and what are SUB worlds.

### Megadungeon Puzzle
Something that spans a megadungeon. A passive underlying puzzle.
Spread semi-related (seemingly unrelated) breadcrumbs throughout. Holy texts, abandoned. Old glyphs.

## Investigations & Mysteries
> The Gumshoe System is designed around the idea that investigative scenarios are difficult to run with most role-playing systems. The problem is identified as important clues being missed due to failed dice-rolls, resulting in play grinding to a halt.

> The Gumshoe System is designed to solve this by making the game not about finding clues, but about interpreting them. Attention is given to designing investigative scenarios, while at the same time the focus is put on encouraging the players to take control of the investigation (and, thereby, the story being told).

There was a video on how to talk run an adventure like this, but it was a lot of common sense. Don't rely on rolls (at least not for critical things, they NEED to find clues). Use rule of 3 clues - plethora of clues, players won't necessarily make sense of it anyway. Don't throw in red-herrings unless there's counter-evidence. If players can think it's not clear, you probably made it too convoluted. A lot of preparation to be made here up front.

## Battlefield Design
Thoughts on what to include in battles. Spice and dynamism.
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/j7p42l/the_missing_ingredient_some_thoughts_on/

### Killing fields
Large open space without obstructions and cover. Pure test of skill / stat mastery. Long awaited enemy.
Both face off knowing only their skills and wits save them from death. Powerful.
Alternatively; arena flex. Throw low-level monsters at party.
### No Man's Land
Both sides pointing at each other at all times. Graveyard of bodies in the middle.
Ditches / moats / thick brush in center can heighten risk of crossing.
Taxes melee classes. They need ways around / protection from enemy snipers.
Alternate paths can be a den for harvester enemies. Make this exciting.
Once they reach other side, it's mostly over.
Sorcerers / wizards / rangers / monks / ranged will shine. Maybe they are the spotlight clearers.
### Choke Point
Thermopylae. Style.
Players needing to pass it can be limiting. AOE traps? Marching orders. Gas? Rain of arrows?
Enemies forced through chokes are different. Endurance challenge, tanks hold the line. Mages dump into horde behind.
Maybe combine with a skill challenge while they hold the line; pick a lock, activate a shields / mcguffin.
### Broken Battlefield
Cave of stalagmites, decayed skeletons, ob jects from past battles. Chaos battle of ducking, darting and leaping between weird terrain.
Collapsed ruins, large trees, broken sight lines (60ft sight max in any direction).
Make retreating to a better position viable.
Should be horizontal and vertical. Criss-crossing. Atriums to jump up and down to. Parallel height paths. Chandeliers.
Hazards. Enemiers immune to the hazards? Triggerable hazard that PCs can weaponize?
### Attack and Defend
Similar to No Man's Land. But one part is defending with ample cover and lay of the land, time to prepare.
Attackers have to traverse and survive oncoming fire so they can reach the defended point. Asymmetric.
Players as A: constantly under fire. Defenders hold actions. Hazardous terrain. Maybe send combatants, traps to flush them out.
Players as D: send bigger forces at them. give them lay of the land, and let them make preparations.
Best; send your players in as A first to take the point, then have them defend it later. Lets them learn the land first.
### Fog of War
No sight beyond a small radius.
High tension, much fear. Can enemies see them? Good for stealth characters. Ranged characters not so much.
