Tie in some gifts:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/joegou/20_friendly_npcs_bittersweet_last_gifts_to_pcs/

## Mordai
[[mordai]] (under endgame) last visit by [[dahaka]].
patron clearup.
Sever his ties with patron and divine faiths.
A breakthrough feat that lets him retrofit his knowledge by actually using the weave.

## Faey
[[faey]]
Ask. He would think about it.
Arch-faey manager route?
He'll think about it.
Watcher prep.
Will sacrifice himself if __necessary__, but only calculated.

## GW
[[goatweaver]]
Ask. Kavaki end? Die and travel with Kavaki?
judge jury executioner of council(building name?) in neverwinter
maybe a farm for his pets? https://i.redd.it/ry57if0dpsf71.jpg
private kavaki shrine? https://i.redd.it/dvji9bam8gn71.jpg

he has put a serious target on himself with the wand of orcus if he's unwilling to relinquish it.
potion of longevity for GW (1d6+6 years younger 90% chance)
golden `Maul to the City` (+0 ceremonial, +2 CHA)

## Zed
For Jay more than Faey. He is in the ring. But no-one knows

### Waterdeep
[[gregor]], they kind of saved him. it's probably best if his ending is left vague.
he's both mad and somehow thankful (but he doesn't even know where the rubies came from).
meeting the party would be weird, he's got mostly anger towards them.

### Neverwinter
Soulcage for Raffolk found? They have to go after it.
Galeron can set it up if we seed Gilbert.
