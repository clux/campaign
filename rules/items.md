This set of bagpipes is made from what appears to be an enlarged heart, adorned with bone like pipes and accented with blood rosewood. The macabre nature of the pipes is saddened by those that know of the legend of Varminius Tunelass. A bard whose family was taken away from him, memories erased, and forced to do a wicked god’s bidding. The instrument, the once beating heart of his true love, now twisted and distorted into a focus of madness and despair, unknown to the one that wielded it.

While attuned to this set of bagpipes, increase your Charisma score by 3 to a maximum of 23. In addition you may use the bagpipes to cast up to 7 levels of Dissonant Whispers.

All hope is not lost for those that hear the song of Tunelass, despite his twisted visage his true nature could not be hidden behind the schemes of a dark god. While holding his true love’s heart near, he achieved many noble and just deeds, saving innocence and protecting those that could not protect themselves. Atonement meant a new life, one that he could give to others. Once per week you may use the heart’s innate power to cast Resurrection.

In spite of great deeds and lives saved, the bard never got to be with his true love once again, forever unknowingly clutching their heart. A final twist of fate and irony spun by the gods. You may choose to break the bagpipes and open the heart at its core, destroying them entirely, if you do so you may cast wish. A wish that could have undone all that had befallen poor Varmin Tunelass, and brought his family back to him.

So heed all that hear the Song of Tunelass, heralded by the pipes. While he might be gone, his song will forever play on.
