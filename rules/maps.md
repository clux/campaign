# Maps
Mostly from trawling pinterest / various subreddits. Many official maps from past editions (particularly in the giant section).

Generally have favoured ones with less detail as it's easier to project societal details (see [[dungeons]]) onto a sparser map.

## Resources
### Subreddits
- r/dndmaps
- r/battlemaps
- r/inkarnate

## BL2
Some maps were either screengrabs or based on borderlands 2:

- Argentil Peak == Digistruct Peak map
- Castle Never's spire == the handsome's sorcerer's spire

## Creation
https://dungeonscrawl.com/ is great for making maps in the dyson style.
Tried some other generators as well (used one for telnarquel), but most don't have the versatility or variance that you get from dungeon scrawl

The donjon one also can be useful for inspiration (but hardly ever for use):

probably most versatile maps for our style (used for irithyll, acropolis, ormolu, boreal mine)
#### Crosshead

Very cool large dungeons (used for gilgrin vault)
