## Supporting; Knowledge Checks
https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/g9t6dk/using_knowledge_checks_to_create_player_immersion/
Don't just have knowledge checks be, binary success/failure investigation/arcana/religion rolls:

Ask players to __give a compelling suggestion for why you might know this__. Make them link it to their backstory / story.
Just don't go over the top.

Eg: My mentor used to have a passion for herbs. When he took breaks from teaching me magic, he often spent hours lecturing me about their properties and uses, and even tried to take me some early morning walks to collect some - would he have told me about this?

If the players try, but it doesn't seem like a good source of information, __try to provide an alternative__. Reward the behaviour.
Lower DCs if you have a compelling reason in a PCs backstory!
If players narrowly miss the DC, reveal some information except one crucial detail (which they remember wrong).
Nat 20 might result in an anectote of why it it is so well-imprinted into their memory (they could create an NPC from their past - creates more canon in their backstory).

### Knowledge checks during a fight
- Asking information in the middle of a fight does not require an action, but it is harder - the DC goes up by 5 as the character's focus is split.
-  It must be done before you take any action.
-  If, during combat, you fail on your memory roll by by 5 or less, your character has the information on the tip of their tongue, but the memory hasn't surfaced quite yet . This has the following consequences:
   * Your character will remember the information when there is a moment of calm.
   * Alternatively, you can push your luck to focus and try again at the beginning of your next round. If you fail that time your character is distracted! You use your action to Dodge.
- Rolling a natural 1 on a knowledge check during a fight means the player takes the Dodge action as they lose focus.

## alcohol

### intoxication levels
1. DC11	*Tipsy*	Disadvantage on ability checks
2. DC13	*Drunk*	Speed halved due to dizziness. Disadvantage on saving throws.
3. DC15	*Hammered* Disadvantage on attack rolls. Assume a Drunk Persona for as long as you're intoxicated. Failing the save by 10 or more results in vomiting.
4. DC17	*Blacked Out* You will not remember anything from now on. In initiative, you act as if under the effects of Confusion except acting "normally" is in line with your Drunk Persona. If your DP is non-violent, then you will not make any attacks. The effect ends if you drop below this intoxication level. Failing the save by 5 or more results in vomiting.
5. DC20	*Comatose* You fall unconscious and will not wake for 3d4 hours.
6. DC25	**Dying** You fall unconscious and unless the poison is quickly removed from your bloodstream by way of Lesser Restoration, or a similar spell, straight roll death saves

### drunk personas

1. **Sloppy** Highly likely to spill your drink, or someone else's, or anything else you touch. Constant belching, with intermittent farting, which you find hilarious. Completely unaware of wardrobe malfunctions or how loud your voice is. You're stumbling all over the place and need someone else's help to really get anywhere.
2. **Waterworks*** Everything is so sad. Remember the good times? Those were great times. Now everything is bad and it's just so upsetting! So stressful! Just make sure you tell your friends that you love them and that you're sorry. Gods, you're so sorry. Do they hate you? They might hate you.
3. **Rage Incarnate** Godsdammit everything is pissing you off and you're sure as hell letting people know. You feel like you just wanna hit something, or someone, or both. Better yet, hit someone with something. See that guy? Fuck that guy!
4. **Je T'adore*** You feel really good. Other people? They feel even better. You bet if you got together with someone it'd feel great. Thank the gods so many people here look hot as the nine hells. Forget subtlety, you're trying to get lucky!
5. **The Birthday Suit** It is too hot in here. Or is it your clothes? It's probably your clothes. Get rid of them; they're too constricting anyway! Nude is way more comfortable! Besides, you got nothing to be ashamed of!
6. **Motherly*** Goodness gracious, who let all these children out without parental supervision? It's up to you to take care of these babies! Corral them and make sure they have everything they need; warm clothes, good food, and of course, your infinite wisdom!
7. **Storyteller** You've had so many interesting experiences in your life that you just have to share them with everyone here. Some things might be embellished, others might be complete fabrications, but no one knows that! All you want is to tell them stories!
8. **Kleptomaniac** There's a lot of really neat stuff here, stuff you'd really like to have, but they're probably not for sale. That's okay, if you're discreet enough maybe you can just slip it into your pocket and walk away all nonchalant. No one will notice, right?
9. **Dare Devil** You really want to impress people here. Maybe you can pull off some tricks! Like jumping from there to way over there, or doing a flip off the table, or drinking something that's on fire! That will definitely make them think you're cool!
10. **Life of the Party*** You feel like you're having the greatest night of your life! Everyone here is awesome! Crack jokes! Laugh at everything! Dance like no one is watching!

## substance abuse

### Void (Super grim Divinity 2 style substance)
Ideas from https://old.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/jhepq7/void_and_the_grinners_a_nightmarish_cartel_for/
All of it have great ideas so leaving it here. They also build a 1-3rd level adventure idea based on a cult of masochists who slowly turn into beholder like features (maybe umberhulk origin story idea).

> Void is a dark and viscous substance, appearing as either deep blue, purple, or black depending on the lighting and the batch. If one looks closely at a vial of void, they might notice that it seems to move and swirl about of its own accord. Void is extremely addictive and is injected subcutaneously using a large metal syringe. Its viscosity often causes it to bubble out from the injection site, damaging surrounding tissues and creating large lesions on a user’s arms. Due to the lack of disposable syringes, injection instruments are typically shared among several addicts. This leads to the spread of various diseases, most notably cackle fever, sewer plague, and sight rot.

> Beyond the uncanny resilience void grants, it is known for several other properties. Its primary feature is the euphoric highs users get. Users enter a dreamlike state, drawing upon heightened senses to help them experience the world as much more pleasing than it really is. A more disturbing property of void is the pleasure one derives from experiencing pain while high. Void addicts are effectively turned into masochists and have no fear of pain or damage to their bodies (they are often seen self-mutilating for pleasure). Void is also known to augment the brain’s receptiveness to psychic energies, and this is thought to be the source of the hive-like tactics and mentality of the Grinners.

> Void begins to permanently alter the body after the first few months of addiction. These changes first manifest in the paling of the skin, which becomes clammy. Addicts also experience total hair loss and extreme loss of weight within the first few months. After some time, void begins to warp and disfigure the body. An addict’s teeth will naturally sharpen, their skull shape might warp, their eyes may change sizes or colors separate of each other, and they might begin to become lopsided in their musculature. Reptilian-like eyes and bony protrusions are also common. Less common is the development of translucent skin, which reveals the addict’s muscles, tissues, organs, and blood vessels underneath. Void also damages the brain in a process known as brain rot.

> Void hardens and expands into sharp protrusions when left at a cool temperature. Thus, it is always kept slightly warm. Void addicts who die in the cold are known to become immensely heavy and grow large crystalline spikes from their corpses.

> Void is incredibly dangerous to manufacture as it is distilled from beholder pus. Once a beholder is captured, it is injected with a cocktail of stimulants and sedatives that prevents it from sleeping or moving. The beholder’s tongue is bolted to its bottom jaw, and its main eye is either removed or blinded. The eyes on each of its stalks are then impaled with a needle attatched to a large tube. These wounds are allowed to fester, generating large amounts of pus, blood, and fluid which are then pumped through the tubes into large distillery vats for processing. The pus is separated from other liquids and purified to become void.


**Delivery**: Subcutaneous injection of 1ml of void is an effective dose.
**Addiction DC**: Extremely addictive. The creature must succeed a DC 18 constitution saving throw each use or become addicted.
**Initial Effects**: A high creature experiences void-induced masochism, dreamlike euphoria, immunity to fear, and advantage on perception checks.
**Secondary Effects**: A high creature experiences disadvantage on intelligence checks, advantage on rolls to resist dying from disease (but not when stopping its progression), vulnerability to psychic damage and disadvantage against charm effects.
**Side-Effects**: After 1d4 months of use, the following occurs in slow progression: hair loss, pale and clammy skin, sharp teeth, warping body and eyes, translucent skin. Brain Rot: for every 1d4 months a creature spends addicted to void, it must make a DC 15 constitution saving throw or permanently lose 1 point of intelligence as its brain is slowly liquified .
**Overdose**: If a creature takes more than one dose of void less than 4 hours apart, it must make a DC 15 constitution saving throw or fall unconscious. If the creature fails the save by 5 or less, it is blinded permanently. If it fails the save by over 8, it dies.
**Withdrawals and Satiation**: If an addict does not take void at least once every 14 hours, they begin cravings and hallucinations. The addict gains one level of exhaustion for every 24 hours it away from void. Instead of dying on level 6, a creature must roll 1d12 + 5. This determines the number of days the creature spends on exhaustion level 5. After the last day, the creature rolls a DC 12 constitution check. On a success, it recovers from its addiction (although it retains any modifications). On a failure, it becomes comatose or dies (DM’s choice). There are possible ways to negate these effects, including magical therapy and alchemical solutions.
**Street Price**: Void costs anywhere from 5sp to 5gp, depending on the buyer. Poorer people have their void ‘subsidized’ by the Grinners.
