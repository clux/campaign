# Nerfs
Subtle ways we nerf certain abilities to avoid things that are a bit OP.
Mostly reserved for bosses to ensure the fights aren't complete walkovers.

The things we care about are hard-disabling skills that have low cost:
- charm/stun/polymorph/paralyze
- mind control/hold

## General Solutions
- tank enemies to absorb skills
- higher DCs on specific things
- higher HP (but boring and slow soln)
- counterspell (where it applies)
- special purpose spell (like multi-cast wards / reskins)
- control positioning on battle (bosses have misty step)

## Resistance Limiters
- everyone has fire/lightning res and all cool spells are fire -> necro reskin
- extra spells in different elements for bosses https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/mrbg15/kibbles_generic_elemental_spells_all_the_spells/


## Stun Limiters
- always have legendary resist for it (let them burn through to earn it)
- CON SAVE PROFICIENCY / RESILIENCE FEAT
- STORY FUDGE: can only have it drop reactions / one attack for a turn
- Make Slow spell (Somnambulists Wraps) more attractive

## Charm Limiters
- fey ancestry
- constructs
- "under the influence of aboleth magic already"

## Polymorph Limiters
- "does not affect huge/gargantuan creatures" WHY
- free action
- legendary resist
- slippery mind (rogue 15th power) - wis save proficiency

## Transmutation Limiters
- TRANSMUTATION immunity for bosses?
- side effects for transmutation
- polymorph -> no turtle -> trex
- fly -> half flying speed due to heavy

## Other OP problems
### Invis Pre-Scouting
Pre-scouting the entire dungeon with an invis familiar.
This limits the DM options greatly, and isn't always that fun in the late game.
Cheap to toss in an enemy with truesight to snipe a familiar once in a blue moon to discourage it.

### Consumables
Potion of Speed effectively gives a free 50% damage increase to a player with two attacks (as well as speed boost and AC) without having to maintain concentration. Enemy spell casters will likely recognise this low level spell and just Dispel the effect (instant).

Potion of Resistance similarly can double the HP pools of players when they use them well. If users get used to just barely surviving on resistance potions then the power creep necessitates that they keep getting them (and at the same time become increasingly vulnerable to a Dispel). Always split some damage between physical/elemental (physical cannot be resisted by potion), and keep certain elements unavailable for resistance purchase.
