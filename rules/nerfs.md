# Nerfs
Subtle ways we nerf certain abilities to avoid things that are a bit OP.
Mostly reserved for bosses to ensure the fights aren't complete walkovers.

The things we care about are hard-disabling skills that have low cost:
- charm/stun/polymorph/paralyze
- mind control/hold

## General Solutions
- tank enemies to absorb skills
- higher DCs on specific things
- higher HP (but boring and slow soln)
- counterspell (where it applies)
- special purpose spell (like multi-cast wards / reskins)
- control positioning on battle (bosses have misty step)

## Resistance Limiters
- everyone has fire/lightning res and all cool spells are fire -> necro reskin
- extra spells in different elements for bosses https://www.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/mrbg15/kibbles_generic_elemental_spells_all_the_spells/


## Stun Limiters
- always have legendary resist for it (let them burn through to earn it)
- CON SAVE PROFICIENCY / RESILIENCE FEAT
- STORY FUDGE: can only have it drop reactions / one attack for a turn
- Make Slow spell (Somnambulists Wraps) more attractive

## Charm Limiters
- fey ancestry
- constructs
- "under the influence of aboleth magic already"

## Polymorph Limiters
- "does not affect huge/gargantuan creatures" WHY
- free action
- legendary resist
- slippery mind (rogue 15th power) - wis save proficiency

## Transmutation Limiters
- TRANSMUTATION immunity for bosses?
- side effects for transmutation
- polymorph -> no turtle -> trex
- fly -> half flying speed due to heavy

## Other OP problems
### Invis Pre-Scouting
Pre-scouting the entire dungeon with an invis familiar.
This limits the DM options greatly, and isn't always that fun in the late game.
Cheap to toss in an enemy with truesight to snipe a familiar once in a blue moon to discourage it.
