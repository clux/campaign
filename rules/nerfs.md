# Nerfs
Subtle ways we nerf certain abilities to avoid things that are a bit OP.
Mostly reserved for bosses to ensure the fights aren't complete walkovers.

The things we care about are hard-disabling skills that have low cost:
- charm/stun/polymorph/paralyze
- mind control/hold

## General Solutions
- tank enemies to absorb skills
- higher DCs on specific things
- higher HP (but boring and slow soln)
- counterspell (where it applies)
- special purpose spell (like multi-cast wards / reskins)
- control positioning on battle (bosses have misty step)

## Resistance Limiters
- everyone has fire/lightning res and all cool spells are fire -> necro reskin

## Stun Limiters
- always have legendary resist for it (but it eats them fast, or fudge con saves)
- CON SAVE PROFICIENCY / RESILIENCE FEAT
- STORY FUDGE: can only have it drop reactions for a turn (tough feat?)

## Charm Limiters
- fey ancestry
- constructs
- "under the influence of aboleth magic already"

## Polymorph Limiters
- "does not affect huge/gargantuan creatures" WHY
- free action
- legendary resist
- slippery mind (rogue 15th power) - wis save proficiency

## Transmutation Limiters
- TRANSMUTATION immunity for bosses?
- side effects for transmutation
- polymorph -> no turtle -> trex
- fly -> half flying speed due to heavy
