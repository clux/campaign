# Philosophy

## Bosses
Most bosses in the second half for the campaign were homebrewed quite a bit to create memorable closing points for large story arcs.
Exceptions: demon lords. Had clarified they were as written earlier.

- [[kiaransalee]] (a little too complicated, was hard to run)
- [[irae]] (lich/sorcerer with revenancer plot items and chronomancy, and shield guardian skins)
- [[arklem]] (lich/wizard with crazy stats from items and chronomancy overcharge burst)
- [[felgolos]] (at dracolich stage; some things to emulate brass dragon)
- [[umnos]] (mounted combatant storm giant on an ancient dragon with crazy items)
- `Neri` in [[halos-2]] (quintessent storm giant with crazy bow and spirits)
- `Serissa` + `Havil` in [[halos]] (quintessent with contingency, and crazy giant defense)
- `Zoltan` in [[gilgrin]] (re-skinned Zalto with spells and a dreadnaught helper)
- `Matriarch` in [[66-gilgrinvault]] (construct with summons and tensers transformation)
- `Arazia` in [[rimehaze]] (void giant with spells and Irae helping)

## Items/Spells
Most items for the campaign were homebrewed, and an entire spell school of [[chronomancy]].
Many of these were nerfed or tweaked during the campaign (after discussion).

Successes:
- Conductors Tuning Fork: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2011566-conductors-tuning-fork (a bit OP, but could control with LG res)
- Dragonwood (Hanzo bow): https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2819631-dragonwood
- Grand Obsidian Subscription Ring: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/3003243-grand-obsidian-basic-subscription-ring
- Somnambulist's Wraps: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2011396-somnambulists-wraps (shifted stun use onto Slow which made battles easier to predict)
- Sunwuko's Spirit: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2011597-sunwukos-spirit (the AOE heal gave the 3p party some extra tankiness and they were rewarded for clever use)
- Wand of Overwhelming Energy: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/526752-wand-of-overwhelming-energy (fun to have Mordai risk self-damage with overcharged lightning bolts)
- Belt of Giantkind: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2040547-belt-of-giantkind (simple, but very good major boss reward)
- Book of Exalted Deeds: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/3001386-book-of-exalted-deeds-goatweaver (ended up with good roleplay setup for GW)

Most worked out OK, but some did slow down the game a bit. (E.g. Stormbow)

Needed work:
- Extinction: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/3105572-extinction (what it could absorp was actually not that much)
- Golden Scourge: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2042213-golden-scourge (divine smite arc flail from felgolos, the crit stuff was always going to be better)
- Oathkeeper: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/3001354-oathkeeper: The CON save ultimately made it not work much vs big enemies, and when they weren't big it wasn't needed.
- Stormbow: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/2011786-stormbow (wording on the infused Lightning Arrow spell slowed down flow)
- Wave : https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/427041-wave-dormant -> https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/579927-wave-awakened ([Cube of Force was a problem](https://clux.github.io/probes/post/2020-10-04-antimagic-revisited/) that early)
- Celerum's Timepiece: https://www.dndbeyond.com/magic-items/1281558-celerums-timepiece (became a lot for Guy to handle with [[chronomancy]] extra cast spells on top of multiclass caster)
- Condemn: https://www.dndbeyond.com/spells/476387-condemn (was meant to be a surprise thing but Flo found it due to homebrew sharing, also possibly threading too much on wizard domain)

Future goals should be to have smoother flow and optimize for [language, not rules](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OIkwABECfR0) take on the game in general.
