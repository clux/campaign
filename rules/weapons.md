### Blood-Oath
Weapon (shortsword), artifact (requires attunement by a warlock, cleric, or paladin)
Those who swear by this blade, live through.
While attuned to this weapon, you gain proficiency in Intimidation.

- **Draining Presence**: This weapon has a -5 penalty on its attack rolls. Attacks with it deal 1d6 slashing damage plus 3d6 necrotic.
- **Meat Shield**: By attacking a willing ally, you can give yourself invulnerability for 3 combat rounds.
- **Shadow of Death**: You can make a shadow emerge from the blade as an action, taking the form of a humanoid, this is considered an illusion and will only vanish if touched. This can be used twice per day, recharging both uses at dawn.

This ability can be used as many times as you can create shadows.
- **Lore**: Many a demigod fought and killed over control of this blade, a perfect conduit for whatever deity to protect its followers. While originally created for priests to pass their god's will and shield others, it soon grew tainted with the greed of lesser gods. A false prophet currently holds this blade, hiding in dark caves along with its fearful followers, but both him and this blade can be cleansed through blood.

### Ward of Innocence
Weapon (quarterstaff), artifact (requires attunement by a wizard or druid)
A staff said to be held by a Goddess of War, who gave her life to save those devoted to her.
While attuned to this weapon, you have advantage on Intelligence and Wisdom saving throws.

- **Smite the Deserving**: You gain a +1 bonus to you spell attack rolls and to your spell save DC, this bonus is doubled if it targets a creature that damaged you this turn.

- **Light of Hope**: As an action, you can order the staff to light in a radius of 60ft. Undead that see this light target you instinctively.
- ​**Lore**: Created by the Goddess Vandria Gilmadrith, this staff has a single purpose: To protect others. Hidden amongst the treasure of a group of sea-faring bandits lies the staff, unused, and waiting for a worthy soul that strives to protect others.

### Blink
Weapon (dagger), artifact (requires attunement by a creature of demonic of holy descendance)
A set of 3 silver daggers with ancient runic inscriptions on the grip, they act as a singular blade, never separate from each other.
While attuned to this set, as long as you are holding one of the daggers, you can teleport to the location of any of the other two, granted that they are at least 30ft away from you.
These daggers emit a constant electrical discharge, raising the user’s hairs and giving a slight shock to anyone who touches them.

**Life Spark**: On a hit, the daggers do 1d6 lightning damage along with the regular 1d4 damage, these are considered magical weapons for the purpose of damage.

You feel the power of thunder rustling inside this blade, awaiting to be unleashed.

Your body receives 2d4 force damage due to the strain of moving at suck high speeds. This ability can only be used once per day, recharging each dawn.
- ​**Lore**: An artifact stolen by a cult that despises *Insert race of your PC*.

###  The Infernal Creator
For Pendle.
Written by modrons on deal with Dispater. Basically bait for smart people.
Contract paywall. Book can show the vestiges. You agree to 3 terms.
On breach, or loss of property; soul forfeit. You will be collected by next owners.

1. The use of your voice for a day. You must say what is required of you, when the time comes, with an intonation and conviction at your most genuine, and without any form of external signalling to let people know about this deal or any qualms/disagreements you may have with what's being said.

2. The energy of your glory. Should you be part of great conquests, like vanquishing a great evil or saving a kingdom, stories of your participation – no matter how great – will be greatly diminished. You will relinquish the rights to fame for me to leech upon.

3. The souls of your victims. NB: THIS WAS PROBLEMATIC.

Motivation:
> Use of your voice for a day. Your voice (which is from someone true and pure of heart) is used to chant a ritual with thousands of other borrowed voices to do something very evil. The evil ritual tainted your voice and now lawful beings have taken notice of the rituals completion and don’t really care for the defence that you weren’t there, your voice was the one chanting.

> Anyone who signs the contract will always be slightly outshone by their companions in any legends told. Saved a kingdom? The bard will mention everyone, including you, but your stanza will be just that much less remarkable than the others. This only applies to secondhand accounts: anyone who witnesses your deeds will see them as they truly are. Complication: The fiend itself is a Glory Leech, and its sustenance is the renown of those it gives contracts to. After you’ve done enough deeds, and the Glory Leech has nourished itself on your relinquished fame, it has the strength to take your place…either actually possessing you, or manifesting as the ideal version of you who everyone unrelated sees as having really done all your great deeds.

## Hurricane Lance
Weapon (lance), very rare (requires attunement)
You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

The lance has 4 charges. You can expend a charge to surround yourself with a flurry of wind and cast zephyr strike on yourself without expending a spell slot. You can expend a second charge of the weapon (no action required) to extend the spell to target any mount you are currently riding. If you dismount or are forced off your mount, the spell fades from the creature. The weapon regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn.

In addition, you can cast thunderwave once per day at 3rd level (save DC 18) without expending a spell slot and without requiring any somatic components. You must be holding the lance to cast the spell in this way.

> "Nothing can stop me. I'm an unbreaking storm, an unrelenting torrent of power. With this I will pierce the heavens themselves!"

## Love's Embrace
Weapon (greatsword), legendary (requires attunement)

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon can be attuned to by two allied creatures at the same time so long as they attune to it together over the course of a long rest. If the weapon is attuned to by two creatures in this way, the weapon's attack and damage bonus becomes +2 instead.

This greatsword is made of two long scimitars that are held together by a powerful, unidentifiable magic. You can speak the weapon's command word using a bonus action to separate it into two scimitars or recombine them into the greatsword. If you are not already holding it when you speak the weapon's command word and are on the same plane of existence, you can choose to summon either one or both scimitars to your hand as individual blades or as the combined greatsword.

The scimitars have the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet when separated.

Each scimitar also has its own elemental effect — either fire or cold — that inflicts an extra 1d6 fire or 1d6 cold damage with each strike, depending on which sword you hit with. When you hit with an attack using the greatsword, the target takes both fire and cold bonus damage from the attack.

Once per day, each attuned creature can cast fire shield at 4th level. You do not need material or somatic components when casting it in this way.
