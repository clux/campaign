Empathetic, but looks for loopholes, no worship.

Doesn't want to reveal why they are here. They're really meant to deploy troops to Waterdeep after a sign for help (what they say). But they are further out than that.
Actually just looking for the Empress.

Member of Order of Unseen Lovers.
Raises white flag when near.

### EBA: Searching
http://dndspeak.com/2017/12/100-sea-travel-events/

Planks at first. Barells.

Devil encounter selling drugs if nothing interesting. During watch.

### EBA: Whirlpool
Into astral sea.
Deep eye in pool.

Xial hook..

### EBA: Abandoned flayer ship
Clairvoyant priest on the ship? Half-god.

Attack scenario, tentacles arriving, wrapping around ship.

#### NB: Undead vs Flayers
The undead are not seen favourably by the flayers. But they allow Orcus to roam the seas and make space for the flayers. Abandoned spots can cause new hotspots for flayers. If Orcus wastes his forces prematurely on the sword coast, then they are going to lie undefended for the flayers.

3 emmisary ulitharids will converge on NW, WD, BG. The cities will slowly become consumed after their forces are withered fighting the Demon Lords (who should ultimately be pushed back).
#### NB: Gith vs Flayers
Gith control the astral sea and want to hunt the Flayers to extinction. If they go to the astral sea they can find artifacts to help them against the flayers. Also Gith in Arcanoloth place.
