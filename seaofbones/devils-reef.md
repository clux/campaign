"We were always warned about swimming there. Orolan lost his son (fishing) to a monstrous acid breathing snake there, and put some magic around it. Not sure if it's still active now."

Actual elven burial chamber beneath ancient hatch. Those who sealed the rift in days of old.

## 6 elven barbarians
- Arel Magstina – slain by bone debris on deck
- Jassin Naemoira – slain by Orcus during the great seal
- Saida Naemoira - slain by the Great Snake
- Caeda Dorgwyn – slain by undead pirate
- Falael Ralokas – slain by Orcus before the sinkening
- Vaeril Kaeris

Last one shows up as a ghost to protect the place. Corellan sent them here to stop orcus from invading 500 years ago during similar mind flayer heist. Flayers went undetected.

We have vowed to never speak of what we did, and so we made this place to disappear.
WHILE THIS PLACE REMAINS, THE PURPOSE OF THIS PLACE MUST REMAIN SECRET.

The ghost like figure, tries to maintain a noble pose, has several broken bones, arms and legs pointing in unnatural directions.

If they can convince him that they know of the Rift, then he will let them through. Otherwise puzzle.

Beyond door. Slab with names. "To those whose lives were sacrificed for Toril. These names are commemorated here in the darkness, destined to be forgotten outside the confines of this chamber. Their bodies denied entry to the afterlife until this place is washed away and the rift below coverd by the sands of time."

Seal already broken by Tammeraut.

Vaeril Karis' grave is partially submerged in Silt.

## Door
Only accessible if Vaeril's ghost is dead or he is convinced the rift is broken. If they try to force the door he attacks.

> Tree of Arvendor.

They can also kneel by the statues of the Correlan / Araushnee.
"We pledge to ensure this place remains secret"
"No thread shall lead from this place. (Dark – free hair)

Fight: 1 sword wraith commander, 5 sword wriaths. Bump +1 on all attacks. Use call to honor on commander in beginning to summon 5 others.

### Tombs
- +1 light crossbow, 3 bolts of teleportation
- Moon touched long sword +1..
- Breast plate+1. Fire resistance.
- Ivory Goat (Figurine of Wonderous Power)?
- Boots of Dancing (cast irresistible dance on self when fleeing) +2 performance checks.

Each loot dims the light on each tomb! It has blindsight..

### LAST TOMB
Halfway into the wall. If they pull at it. The
Near reef hidden cave liken entrance.
Can maybe flesh out something in here with
Treasure in abandoned cavern (bloodstone)
Some symbiotic creature (sea hag coven)
NPC: the son of Orolan (but corrupted)
Enemy: Froghemoth?
Enemies: 2x alhoons?
Mindwitness? Sentry for flayer colony? What would it know?

Why can we go down into the reef without being underwater?
Maybe we can't? Ancient civilization may have a hidden airlock..
Maybe ancient mechanism purges the water?

Maybe only real water entrances come from side passages that cross height boundaries (causing different sea level inside)
