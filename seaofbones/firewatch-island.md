Below are complimentary side notes to the Salt Marshes.

### Resting
Prevent it with a Dream wraith:
https://www.5esrd.com/gamemastering/monsters-foes/monsters-by-type/undead/dream-wraith/

### Entrance
Depending on where they go. Scary encounters.

1-8 follow notes.
9 note is s/storm lord/storm queen
13 room with secret entrance + map (island overview)

### Rasp peryton
Killed person in tower. Attacks new people.
P245 in saltmarsh. Swoop in with dive + curse.
Then targets one for extraction (144 hp so quick in and out) - leg saves to survive.

### Orolan
Dead from first wave. He was exhausted from his spell. Mind shielding ring stashed.
Devils Reef (illithid subplot)
We were always warned about swimming there. Orolan lost his son (fishing) to a monstrous acid breathing snake there, and put some magic around it. Not sure if it's still active now.
Bloodstone gem reward.

### Secret Grotto
Downstairs.
Janore Stormswake female human. Wants to be a cleric.
Tells of the Emperess. A transport ship. Docked by the Grotto about 2w ago. Damaged.
We were going to help fix the Empress.. But then. A war galley fully loaded with pirates, with the name just as Orolan painted. We thought we were all doomed at that moment, but Orolan was prepared. He had a been reaching out to his goddess that entire week. Concentrating on a ritual. When that cursed ship stared unleashing its horde upon the shore, he unleashed a tidal wave, unlike one you've ever seen. The Galley started keeling over, but drifted out of the harbor past devils reef. Orolan was drained and delirious. He went on and on about us needing to anchor the ship.  Said the ship could not go down in the Pit.

The galley did drift off as Orolan confirmed with a sense of despair in his voice. We didn't think much off it, but soon after the attacks started happening.

Peryton? We have scared that off before. Is it back? I do hope Aaron is alright.

Have not dared to venture outside due to all the creatures barraging the fort. They could still be hiding. Event at day we'd heard loud monstrous screams, along with some particularly horrifying cackling.

Did you see Aaron? He was on the Emperess, and he was helping us out fortify the hermitage after the attacks started happening.
Suggest looking for him. He could help (was in fact dead)
Get Orolon's scrolls. They might help (FROM AREA 9 think they missed it).

Barret Gloffrin (commoner) very ill male human (dies in 1hour on failed CON save)
Morley Tobe (commoner) slightly ill, heavlily indebted male dwarv
Put there by Gedesto.

NOTE: s/storm lord/storm queen.
Note is a bit banal.. But not sure if can tweak it much.. Trench of Darkness. Was sealed away 200y ago to prevent darkness gathering therein.
### 24 tower lvl4
Pc eaten here if Rasp succeeds. Signal beacon where Aaron died scribbling the message (bell attracted rasp)
### NPCs
Seagull (true-polymorph perma concentrate) [[virgil]] near end after battle.
Randos who survived the onslaught under kitchen.
Remains of priest? Ringing the bell and scribed the warning by the winged creature.

# Last stand
Janore from [[firewatch-island]] doesn't know what to do now. It's getting dark.
The rest of them want to stay in the bolt hole.

They can short rest only before enemies arrive.
They have an hour before darkness. With the weather getting worse, you wouldn't want to return in it.

## Horde scenario
- 4: 5 zombies (CR1/4), 3 drowned blades (CR2), 1 drowned ascetic (CR3)
- 11: 5 zombies, 2 drowned blades (CR2), 1 drowned ascetic (CR3)
- 12: 1 drowned ascetic CR3
- 17: 1 drowned assassin CR4
- 21: 2 drowned blade CR2

Total: 3 ascetics, 1 assassin, 7 blades, 10 zombies

Not super difficult (6850XP, but Adjusted to 27400 due to 21 monsters)

If they fight smart it's "Medium"
If they fight stupid, it's deadly.

Without the 10 zombies make it "merely deadly" though. And they should be toast quickly.

(Added one Blade more than text book, and text book was for LVL9 party. Can add one or two more, or remove one and buff the ascetic+assassins one CR)
Adjust the ascetic to CR4 (+1AC, +20HP, +1hit),
Adjust the assassin to CR5 (+1AC, +1 hit, uncanny dodge)

**Give them time to rig the place.**

Vines, roof collapses. slipperiness oil. Reinforcing the door. Use arrow slits to attack.
