## Most relaxed setup for Sphinx
Climbing posts. Strangely angled research desks, pools. Bottles strewn around. Crystal Whiskey Bowl.

## Laboratory
Side-part of Sphinx' main chamber.
Complicated room of cylinders with white mist being gathered (for berries).

Many levers and pipes that either extend upwards, transparent white liquid flowing in them, or ones that seem to extrude below with

## Runoff chamber
Path to backside of mountain. Sphinx's playground exit.
In chamber is some serious time mist byproducts.

Small room with purple mist runoff from machinery. Normally no one touches it, but they can get to it through level in lab

## Future
Better guards in centre. Have to take back exit. But will be conspicuous in future. Can find stash.
Main chamber largely trashed, huge opening in mountain. Dragon now Ancient.

Jendn's eagle flies over the island.
Island is filled with thousands of civilians (pretty packed). Wooden houses.

### Activities
Archery competitions
Culinary competitions

### City
Food-inn, no place for visitors, but food available. Culinary thingy.
### The Succulent Doe
Many people have bows. Jendn being asked by 10 people. Multiple woven together pieces of thick animal hide. It's carefully sown together and it's got two huge, elaborate metal buckles across the center of it keeping it together. The hood is lifted at this point and you can see this way blond hair

### Farmlands
No trees. Sugar canes grow, looks trampled by animals. Not that much more area used to farming than there is area used by people. Sectioned off by magic.

Sphinx inside. has his research chamber + celestial berry farm with artificial growth using Chronomancy.
Trapped by Void Dragon. Large chamber somewhere where dragon takes roost.

## Setup
Present: sphinx is caught in "Preserved indefinitely (8th level spell)" - only visible as frozen image.


## Time device
Day-of-the-tentacle style. Misty tub available deep in the dungeon.
They can use it to travel to 3 discrete points { -30y, 0, +30y } in time.
Energy available as time liquid? They need it to cast spells?
Give out a "Retry Way Point" stake?
Time Walk. 4th
See [[chronomancy]].

## Talk to sphinx
Describe scroll through skill challenge.
Wants them to go back in time to avoid it from being trapped. Difficulty communicating with them.
Try to scribe the scroll as best you can.

EXPLAIN CONSEQUENCE OF TIME TRAVEL TO TELL THEM THAT THEY CAN KILL FUTURE SELVES.
CLUE THEM INTO THE POPULATION PROBLEM / OVERUSE OF MAGIC IN PRESENT.
CROSS TIME TELEPATHY.

## DOTT
- NO LIVING MATTER IN EDDIES TUB.
- Either stabilize present by securing sphinx, or limiting population.
- Set up ambush in present to get dragon in present later?

## PAST
- Petrification sidequest?
- Kill Sphinx to prevent timetravel from existing. -
- Devout cult believers of GOD X. - NAH
- Cultists have farms they answer prayers.
- Lot fewer people in the past.
- Discover temple in the past, break in. Prevent dragon from getting there?
- Sphinx already lives in there. Teach chronomancy in the past.
- Prevent population expanse?
- IF they prevent too well, they're evil.
- Past sphinx can reuinte them in present.

## PRESENT
- Sphinx there, guiding their belief.
- Conflict.
- Sphinx lets them live beyond their means by aiding farming magically. Druid spells.
- Summon woodland creatures. Goodberry.
- People starving. Prayers in shrine not answered. (Sphinx incapacited).
- Cutting down trees, to make a boat, but not enough trees, conflict. Infighting.

## FUTURE
- Ancient Void dragon replaced old god.
- Manipulating leader of cult. Astral clothes.
- Prayers are answered, but by different god.
- Grow pearls? Liase with mermaids. Pirate base?
- Gold Golem. Diamond Golem on guard.

- Stealth mission. Humans not strong. Paranoia.

Food: Summon displacer beasts. Dire squirrels. Void philler.
Philly Steak Sandwich – void meat.

Send back petrification ray.

## Complications
Each use of the device:
- creates a copy of themselves that is doomed to die?
- drains them of powers the further away from source time / timeline
- Has a chance to malfunction and send them to dinosaur battle

## NPCS
## Zelben
![](zelben.png)

- Leader of Booze Religion. 1 commandment. God needs booze.
- Gives out berries to Jendn so he can help cast in the hunt.
- Elegant Staff + Robe stands out. The rest of him is a bit in shambles. Hair goes everywhere, 50 year old.
- Naïve helper in the past – young, inherited same stuff.
- No shave, long hair in past. Middle wavy hair + scruff later + beard.
- Unconscious irritations: if people don't appreciate his work. Eyes shifty.
- Slightly manipulated the Sphinx to help out in the name of the people.
- Minor "greater good arguments".
- How are everyone getting food in the future? "Ooh, that's a great idea."

### Items:
- Bag of tricks.
- Horn of Valhalla
- Staff of Woodland Power (reduce cooldown on conjuration spells)

His horn is well hidden in his room in the future.

### Tactics
Horn + Fire Storm + Tsunami (maybe) + Giant Scorpion

### Zelben Past
- Weak sorcerer/druid turned farmer, discovered opening to Sphinx.
- Became the spokesperson.
- Sphinx makes holy berries / mistletoe for him, so he can cast: good berry + conjure woodland beings.
- Talks about it. The God in the Mountain.
- Sphinx gets left alone for time studies. Glory days of Sphinx. Just starting to make berries. Zelban + him are best buds.

### Zelben Present
Sphinx incapacitated so him being the religious leader in a castle is unpopular. Fortress magic keeps him safe. He knows the sphinx is aging things and experimenting with time. Secret

Has whiskey.
## Andariel [[andariel]]

## VOID DRAGON
Arrived in present and has locked sphinx down in stasis. Adult Void Dragon, well-fortified in present.
ToB138. Nihilanth. Wings showing reflections of stars. Light warps around its face and there's a disk around the centre of its jaw. However, seems to bend around it underneath.

"You should not have come here."
Aura of madness attack. Frighten everyone -> Mess with dials.
"Do not touch that."

Wants quiet around his area so he can use his magic to become ancient. Lair actions in present.
Energy beams redirected from lab into chamber with berries

## EBA
Dinosaur battle. If this happens, describe rip in spacetime.  Which lasts for 3 rounds in combat vs Trex?

## Translocation
- Natural Preservation
- Wine -> Vinegar
- Whiskey -> Aged Whiskey
- Wealth in bank -> Interest
- Plant a seed -> Tree
- Bushes -> Forest
- Animal sanctuary? -> real animals not dead

### Translocation for non-living matter
Initial pool of purple liquid with steam coming from it. Escape through it at first.

The mist seems to surround you from nowhere, it's dense and envelops you like a liquid. Your arms instinctually push against it to see if you can control yourselves and you manage to swim against it, but you have no sense of direction. The mist is everywhere, dense, and carrying you what feels like downward in some diagonal direction. You hit the angled bottom of the ground and you are suddenly propelled upwards. You see a hole of shining white light above you. It's thin, and it's approaching fast. You are being pushed towards it. "what do you do reaching it?" Expelled out upwards. Gravity takes over and you land (ACRO check) on the ground.

They can dump things in the hole and it immediately bounces between all the misty holes in the other direction. As they turn around to look at the holes they see purple liquid exude from the hole and only a white mist remains. They can speak through it. But they notice it there's a discomfort in touching it.

**SENDING STONES!**

### Fixing Time Pool
Get Chronomancy spell Timewalk (special 5 – not in list), lets them manoeuvre as they see in all machines.

### Quest hooks examples
- Aged whiskey for Past sphinx or persuade it.
- Sphinx can give celestial components from past to save present. (best reward)
- Sphinx has chronomancy in past. MAIN QUEST
- They can cull present as well... (evil reward)
- Give crystal bowl from present to past Sphinx

## Future Dragon
"Oh, look, so you are alive. Not the best place to escape to was it.

## Ideas
Timeline steins gate mover?
Is your timeline doomed?

Do you know if your version from the future is in the right timeline?
Meeting a beat up version of them. One dead. Took bad turn.
Meeting a decrepit od version of them. Never made it out.
Conflicting information. Best info from the ones that seems the most like you.

Sphinx is in its own cage. Failed to adhere to its own timeline.

Areas where time passes faster / slower.
Areas that require manipulation of time.
Elemental rooms.
Some require solving in the future.

Bring pot of fire to reverse time room. Turn into earth.
Setting up something complex by triggering timestop to start again.

### Continuing adventure?
- Boat into astral sea.
- Dragon escapes to astral sea? Sphinx chases with boat from present?

### Futurama alternate timelines
Slightly different versions of themselves
Cowboy bender
Fire genasi Hjarka
Aasimar warlock
Rogue gnome (normal? Ftlolz)
Pirate universe
Kua-toa universe
Kobold universe.
Battle self?
Change self?

 ## Enemies
Childhood nalfeshnee

## Alternate concept: Stable time loop scenario
They travel back to the past and meet themselves.
If they see versions of themselves fighing, they are from the future from their point of view.
Ergo, they  must do either:
- Do stuff in present before travelling back in time and meet past selves
- Travel back immediately and meet future selves

In either case, there's a chance that they'll get to betray themselves.
- When they travel back they can betray what they saw from their past selves
- When they eventually become future selves, they can portray what they say from their past ones

Actually really hard to ensure..

### Alternate concept: Timeline idea?
- Characters having travelled back in time freezes themselves to get to a later timeline
- Present: characters enter dungeon
- Characters travel back in time
- Characters find cryo frozen players from further past and wakes them up

Hard to script this..

MULITPLE TIME LINES BETTER
They get to interact with version of themselves form other timelines and exist in different parts, but never their own.

Lead with: good to see you again.
Travel to past to setup
