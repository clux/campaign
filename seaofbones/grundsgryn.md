Climbing posts. Strangely angled research desks, pools. Bottles strewn around. Crystal Whiskey Bowl.

## Laboratory
Side-part of Sphinx' main chamber.
Complicated room of cylinders with white mist being gathered (for berries).

Many levers and pipes that either extend upwards, transparent white liquid flowing in them, or ones that seem to extrude below with

## Runoff chamber
Path to backside of mountain. Sphinx's playground exit.
In chamber is some serious time mist byproducts.

Small room with purple mist runoff from machinery. Normally no one touches it, but they can get to it through level in lab

Better guards in centre. Have to take back exit. But will be conspicuous in future. Can find stash.
Main chamber largely trashed, huge opening in mountain. Dragon now Ancient.

Jendn's eagle flies over the island.
Island is filled with thousands of civilians (pretty packed). Wooden houses.

Food-inn, no place for visitors, but food available. Culinary thingy.
### The Succulent Doe
Many people have bows. Jendn being asked by 10 people. Multiple woven together pieces of thick animal hide. It's carefully sown together and it's got two huge, elaborate metal buckles across the center of it keeping it together. The hood is lifted at this point and you can see this way blond hair

### Farmlands
No trees. Sugar canes grow, looks trampled by animals. Not that much more area used to farming than there is area used by people. Sectioned off by magic.

DoTT?

## Talk to sphinx

## DOTT
- NO LIVING MATTER IN EDDIES TUB.
- Either stabilize present by securing sphinx, or limiting population.
- Set up ambush in present to get dragon in present later?

## PAST
- Petrification sidequest?
- Kill Sphinx to prevent timetravel from existing. -
- Devout cult believers of GOD X. - NAH
- Cultists have farms they answer prayers.
- Lot fewer people in the past.
- Discover temple in the past, break in. Prevent dragon from getting there?
- Sphinx already lives in there. Teach chronomancy in the past.

## Complications
Each use of the device:
- creates a copy of themselves that is doomed to die?
- drains them of powers the further away from source time / timeline
- Has a chance to malfunction and send them to dinosaur battle

## EBA
Dinosaur battle. If this happens, describe rip in spacetime.  Which lasts for 3 rounds in combat vs Trex?

## Translocation
- Natural Preservation
- Wine -> Vinegar
- Whiskey -> Aged Whiskey
- Wealth in bank -> Interest
- Plant a seed -> Tree
- Bushes -> Forest
- Animal sanctuary? -> real animals not dead

### Translocation for non-living matter
Initial pool of purple liquid with steam coming from it. Escape through it at first.

The mist seems to surround you from nowhere, it's dense and envelops you like a liquid. Your arms instinctually push against it to see if you can control yourselves and you manage to swim against it, but you have no sense of direction. The mist is everywhere, dense, and carrying you what feels like downward in some diagonal direction. You hit the angled bottom of the ground and you are suddenly propelled upwards. You see a hole of shining white light above you. It's thin, and it's approaching fast. You are being pushed towards it. "what do you do reaching it?" Expelled out upwards. Gravity takes over and you land (ACRO check) on the ground.

They can dump things in the hole and it immediately bounces between all the misty holes in the other direction. As they turn around to look at the holes they see purple liquid exude from the hole and only a white mist remains. They can speak through it. But they notice it there's a discomfort in touching it.

**SENDING STONES!**

### Fixing Time Pool
Get Chronomancy spell Timewalk (special 5 – not in list), lets them manoeuvre as they see in all machines.

### Quest hooks examples
- Aged whiskey for Past sphinx or persuade it.
- Sphinx can give celestial components from past to save present. (best reward)
- Sphinx has chronomancy in past. MAIN QUEST
- They can cull present as well... (evil reward)

## Ideas
Timeline steins gate mover?
Is your timeline doomed?

Do you know if your version from the future is in the right timeline?
Meeting a beat up version of them. One dead. Took bad turn.
Meeting a decrepit od version of them. Never made it out.
Conflicting information. Best info from the ones that seems the most like you.

Sphinx is in its own cage. Failed to adhere to its own timeline.

Areas where time passes faster / slower.
Areas that require manipulation of time.
Elemental rooms.
Some require solving in the future.

Bring pot of fire to reverse time room. Turn into earth.
Setting up something complex by triggering timestop to start again.
