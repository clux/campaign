# Firewatch last stand
Janore from [[firewatch-island]] doesn't know what to do now. It's getting dark.
The rest of them want to stay in the bolt hole.

They can short rest only before enemies arrive.
They have an hour before darkness. With the weather getting worse, you wouldn't want to return in it.

## Horde scenario
- 4: 5 zombies (CR1/4), 3 drowned blades (CR2), 1 drowned ascetic (CR3)
- 11: 5 zombies, 2 drowned blades (CR2), 1 drowned ascetic (CR3)
- 12: 1 drowned ascetic CR3
- 17: 1 drowned assassin CR4
- 21: 2 drowned blade CR2

Total: 3 ascetics, 1 assassin, 7 blades, 10 zombies

Not super difficult (6850XP, but Adjusted to 27400 due to 21 monsters)

If they fight smart it's "Medium"
If they fight stupid, it's deadly.

Without the 10 zombies make it "merely deadly" though. And they should be toast quickly.

(Added one Blade more than text book, and text book was for LVL9 party. Can add one or two more, or remove one and buff the ascetic+assassins one CR)
Adjust the ascetic to CR4 (+1AC, +20HP, +1hit),
Adjust the assassin to CR5 (+1AC, +1 hit, uncanny dodge)

**Give them time to rig the place.**

Vines, roof collapses. slipperiness oil. Reinforcing the door. Use arrow slits to attack.
