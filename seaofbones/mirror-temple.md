# Mirror Temple
A dungeon in the style of Celeste's Mirror Temple.

## Developments
- [[hanir]] tries to become a champion to [[umberlee]] (fails, goes mad)
- party + [[hjarka]] arrives on the island
- travel in to mirror world, fight their way down to [[umberlee]]
- gain her favour, but [[hanir]] killed

## Temple Entrance
Planar gate to the mirror-world where [[umberlee]] resides. The place where [[hjarka]] meets confronts her dual Hergatha.

- Hergatha's elemental powers along with Wave as a conduit causes havoc inside Hjarka – who also houses an arachomental.
- Hergatha is ultimately dead, but her powers linger on in the border planes.
- Together they unlock elemental potential within Hjarka.
- "We are Hergatha We are Ogremoch" ??
- NB: She should also be trying to put down elementals...
- NB: To get wave2 she needs to actually worship Umberlee..

### Intro
She'll see Cameroon in the mirror stuck on the other side
- "How did you get into this mirror?" "Pretty sure you're the one in the mirror"
- "I was just walking around this ancient temple taking a selfie #blessed".

 ### Exploration
- Dark blue vines crawl up from the wall. Magical blue torches light in your vicinity. Mirrors everywhere.
- Red teleport spheres crossing scary ground. Last one lifting you up 100 feet. Some dropping you 50.
- Doors slamming behind you.
- Large statue of Umberlee lighting up.
- Large mirror you're being sucked into at the end.
- No enemies before you're sucked in.
- Maybe friends stuck on other side?

### Twist
When she get sucked in there's red crystals floating in the air. The blue vines now extrude from the surfaces of wall, wriggling with red light.
Runes visible on the walls. All torches now lit. The temple has taken on a darker tone.
Mirror entrances shut, metallic feel to them. One eye emblazoned into the closed mirror. Smaller statues of hergatha visible?


## Mirror World
### Environment
Dark gray aztec runes are glowing with a reddish hue.
Wave not talking until reconciliation in Deep Within.
Faces of various elemental creatures visible. You swear for a second that there's something you recognise in some of these faces. Their eyes move to follow you.
Vines vibrate around you.

### Strange inhabitant
Intro cave for old [[hanir]].

### Environment
Tentacles dealing necrotic damage. Fight first seeker. Four arcamags  start to crawl down Hjarka's leg (initially shapechanged from something on her) PP15 and over to party.

### Seekers
Indicate that blue energy is harmful to creatures here.
Hjarka fighting them
Energy pillars go from glowing red to teal blue.

### After first encounter
Mirror, see self. It's been a while since you've seen a mirror where you can see your own reflection. You take a second to breath and collect yourself. Are you a trespasser in your own world?

If she's distraught, have strength feed through from other side of mirror.

### Cameron Crystalized
Can see him encased in other side of wall in crystals.

- Hjarka! Man, I'm happy to see you!
- Yeah, I'm fine, just been stuck in this crystal for ages.
- Do you "get the feeling that this place knows you? better than you know yourself? (optional)".
- Sure, those monster are coming from you, but the temple is shaping its way around me too. I can feel it.
- The eyes are staring at me...
- Monsters coming from inside me? Hjarka, that is a valid question.
- I'd be happy to discuss how the monsters relate to your inner self. But right now, my inner self is sick of being stuck in this crystal.

### Environment Changes
See eyes peering out of the walls. They are embedded in the purple ornamental walls. Peering at you from the darkness. Large disembodied, tracking you. It appears they disappear entirely when they are blinking (like the wall is covering them).
You need to bust him out of there.

### Cameron Request
Help me out. Bust me out of this thing.
"You're my only hope right now. I believe in you, for real."
"You have to stop being so hard on yourself Alex." "Sorry, I meant Hjarka."
"But this crystal is like, an expression of your negative psychic energy. Or whatever."
"Don't think I can get to the bottom of this while we're stuck in this nightmare dimension."

### Releasing Cameron
Beholder has to crash down on it. It's spikey, and has moments when it pulses with energy of crystals in chamber and pulls towards it. Shock waves as they close in on it.
(If they break the crystals, then the thing can just be smashed)
If you know why you trapped yourself in this thing. Maybe you could bust out.

### Tyrant fight
Actually no tyrant? It's just Hergatha causing fear? Major image...
Crystals remove the following rays if destroyed: Death/Disintegration/Petrify/Paralyzing
Alternatively; disadvantage attacks on them instead. Then they can kill them properly for disabling them.
All other rays are powered by Final crystal around Cameron.
Once it breaks, Cameron shatters, and there's a path open deeper down (hear water).

### Exit
Beholder defeated to reveal blue orb.
They can ultimately grill it full of blue energy. Maybe a sacrificial lock
Hallucinatory terrain exit with invis bridge. Openness to highlight fear. IF DOING THIS THEN JCG KNOWS.

## Resting place
Final awakening.. Confrontation with Hegartha, getting her to join you.
Ideas from Celeste All Dialogues/Full Story Chapter 6 Reflection; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lJhiINCdFDs

Place where Cameron rests. Place they can actually relax.

### Downward Environment
Gradually more lush, oceanic yet elemental.

### Cameron Lines
Had a messed up nightmare. Oh, shit, that eye thing actually happened. Thanks for getting us out of there. How long was I out for? Man what a ride.
IF MENTIONED HERGATHA: How's your existential crises going?
You could've mentioned that your demon doppelganger was on the loose..

How do you cope with that? How do you cope with anything?

You remind me of my sister. Oh you'd love her. Hm, well, you might not get along at first. But you'd eventually love her.  She's a literal mage (okay not literally a literal mage), Alex is just amazing at everything. She's studying abjuration at the Academy. (Remind because you both live deep within your heads). Alex has an amazing internal compass. It's obvious that she'll get where she needs to be. I can see that in you too. Wish I could say the same about myself.

Who do you think built the temple? (looks ancient)

Why here? Kind of just bumming around.  As usual. I started this new job. Finally thought I'd figured out what I was supposed to be doing with my life, but I hated it. So I quit and jumped on your boat. Just felt the urge to get lost in the middle of nowhere. Now that I'm saying it out loud, I realize how flaky it sounds.

Under Pressure? Not really. Everyone is so patient with me. Though I guess I'm putting a lot of pressure of myself. People always think I'm comparing myself to Alex, but I swear that isn't the problem. I'm just worried that I'll never figure out where I'm going.

Sad conclusion; Maybe I should just embrace being lost for a while.

What's it like having a voices in your head? // Having an evil copy of yourself?
Nothing to be ashamed of, Alex deals with a lot of voices in her head too. We can talk about something else if you want. HOPE SHE TALKS.
Whatever happens. I'm sure it's not your fault.
Pointless? You just saved my life Hjarka. That's not  pointless.

Look, you're a good person. A little intense, but a good person.
I think you're just trying to push out of that rut you're stuck in. And that's a totally legit reason to be exploring ancient temples.

Good conclusion; the part of you that's haunting you, maybe she comes with the territory.

- Stuck with her? Well, maybe she's stuck with you too..
- Destroy her? Won't that hurt you too?
- Protecting you? Maybe she thinks she is. She could be some kind of twisted defence mechanism.
- Control her? Maybe you can learn to control her instead of she controlling you.

Why are you traversing this temple anyway? Preaching to the choir here. We all want to find meaning. Painting was a solid job, but frankly with boring subjects or city scenery it got pretty soul destroying sometimes. And that's not even counting all the owls.

Old lady? You ran into her to? What's her deal?

Thanks?. Believing in you was the easy part. Wish I could've helped.
I was pretty useless stuck in that thing.

### Hergatha
She sits perched atop a ledge out of range. You can see her sitting there.
If she tries to talk and reconcile then, she will lash out and bring them all crashing down into the depths.
If she doesn't talk to her, they'll have to slow climb their way down. She'll gawk at them most of the time.
If she tries to talk and doesn't reconcile, she'll keep trying to dissuade them to leave. (3rd person to avoid boring).

### Convo
Beautiful place. Yeah it is (anxiously)
You're not my true reflection. I'm not?
Leave you behind? Why would you say that.
Abandoning me / setting you free? You're so (anxiously)…. Eyes flash red. Stupid
You think you can just leave me behind.
You think you can blame everything on me?
You think you're above me?
ANSWER ME! [tentacle rises out of the ground and grapples you]
Calm down?
You're not above me. And you can't find Umberlee. It's time to accept that.

### Backup Hergatha Dream
Hjarka hunts down herself?

## Deep Within
Jungleous path toward old lady's shack.!
Cats...

### Old lady final
Oh hello again. Given up on chasing your shadow? Probably for the best. Umberlee does not pull any punches.
IF AGREES: Sometimes you gotta know when to throw in the towel. You'll get over it.

### You clearly aren't over it..
A lot of people have come here to do what you are trying to do and failed.
IF FELL: It's a shame you fell. I was starting to think you'd make it.

Never met anyone so angry with themselves. Honestly, I'd thought you'd reach Umberlee just to spite yourself.

The girl you're talking about. It sounds like she's holding you back. Talk to her. Figure out why she is so scared.

Stop wasting both of our time and confront her. What have you got to lose.

You know where to find her. She's part of you right? If you look for her, she won't take long to find.
Know how this works? Of course. I live here.

GIVING UP: A glimpse of truth is enough for most people. There's no shame in getting out of here and coming back another time.

Hard place. Yes, you never really get used to it, but it keeps me sharp.
Confrontational? Sure, it doesn't beat around the bush. This is a place of healing, dear.
First step towards healing is confronting the problem. It's never easy.

Good luck.

**Hergatha** at mirror temple switch
Looking for me? I thought you were done with me.
You think you've got it all figured out.
You think you don't need me.
You expect me to trust you?
No point fighting, we're at the bottom?  I can keep digging. I could drag you to the centre of this world.
Come close to me and I'll make you regret it (angry fear).

Fear immunity. TODO: Goth Hjarka reward.

Victory; she'll help you find the hidden passage towards umberlee's main area.
"You still want to go there?"
Old lady: Good to see you two playing nice.

Cameron: Is this the part of you that that you've been talking about? She's like an adorable goth Hjarka. [hi]

## Path to Umberlee
Kraken boss puzzle – for Awakened Wave.
Activating four pillars, then meet kraken?

Reconcile: Observant feat but +1 extra wisdom. Remove curse and Ogremoch. (Adv on perc)
Not: Keep ogremoch. Immunity to fear. Character flaws.
Hanir: Deck of many things

### Looks
Hallucinatory terrain after beating Hergatha – name puzzle
Beyond is relaxed for most parts. Godess' chambers.

### Fake bridge
Endless chasm over void. Hidden code path to walk across. Otherwise not easy to get there. Flight sure, but reverse gravity will kick in if they fly. Top of the ceiling contains a weird cloud of lightning dangling spikes, and Greater Grells. 172MM.
(Modificaction: +8 hit, 2d8+4 dmg, DC16 grapple). Four of them.
Hallucinatory terrain with letters. Must spell out last
Not spelling their names. Force moved back, 5LG + 1Force.

### McGuffin Diamond
Launches large boulder coming towards them for 10d10 bludgeoning.? Perhaps do the Shark Bowl here. 284 CC. Large diamond
Deck of Many things here.
Belongs to Umberlee.

### Path left
Aparatus of Kwalish DM151
If they take it over they can use it to bash into main temple stairs.  Indicate 6 small holes + claw holes.
If they force their way in, there's a fight. 2x frost giants.??

Superior healing potion. 1
Healing potion. 2
Potion of water breathing: 2

### Underwater passage
Passes on a Divinity Aeterna passage, but underwater. Deep water around. They dodge water weirds.

### Choices
"Glacialus (light up), Undaeroth (light up), Fulguryth (light up)."

Ice / Water / LIghtning Choice
Water part gives Wall of Water (utility 3 spell)
Ice gives Wall of Ice (utility 6 spell)

- Lightning gives Storm Sphere (4 spell – modify so advantage on lightning in general in sphere)
- Ice world requires defeating a White Dragon CR13
- Storm Sphere requires defeating Lightning Eel CR12
- Wall of Water requires defeating Sea dragon + Wormlings.

Persuadable only by giving up something of extreme importance. Party member as a pet
Icy chamber. Ice walk. Glacial inside cave (black ice, transparent, reflective)

#### Undaeroth
Underwater sea dragon CR9. With two wormlings. + 2xCR2
Model is as Anglerfish?

#### Fulguryth
Lightning dragon eel. ToB 146 CR12.

### Morals
OBJECT TO KILLING? There's nothing natural in extending the life of a such a creature. You are aspiring to become something greater. You want the power of a god? It can only be taken. (Kratocracy).

Spectral visions of her struggles? Violent sea battles with other gods?

Hanir was a slave to his own conscience. He would not cast aside his fear, and look at him. Living like a recluse. Scrounging on the scraps that survive in this world. Honestly, I'm surprised he's still alive. You took "The Fates" didn't you, Hanir? I didn't think I'd find someone who'd dare to use my toys like this.

### Addressing Hanir
You had your chance old man. Your magic is weak and unpredictable. DID HE HAVE WAVE? [Ruin card]

The Key (sword) + Flames (she took) + Idiot + The Fates

Aluna.

### Umberlee
[[umberlee]]

#### Lines
My my. You really are relentless aren't you. Thank you for being reasonable and ignoring these silly voices in your head. My champion should be steadfast and not have to deal with this level of impediment.

You appear to be just what I need. If you are... strong enough.. *touches wave* blue flash from it.
*My queen* --- *shhhh*.
"Have you been enjoying her?" "I can restore her powers. I can make her more powerful again. Just.. For you. You enjoyed the invincibility of the cube didn't you?

WANT FROM ME? Oh, not much for now. A proof of your power.

Anyone can defeat an undead eye with a paladin after hampering its power source. My pets are more powerful. (MAYBE GIVE ONE FORCE CUBE).
It's been a while since someone's been here.

### Hard moral questions?
Why do they need the sea? Without controlling it, it controls you

### Feeding kraken
Feed heart to Kraken.
Feed to Slarkrathel (Kraken)

Large fucking chamber water all around (obivous death trap). Glacial shine still there. Lightning ripples through it.

Describe the lights in its various eyes and mutlpile rows of teeth as the gargantuan creature hovers over you. Respects wave.

If offered the heart it will eat it, and glow with elemental relevance.
Ink cloud – can be repurposed as tar with a congealing agent.

### Wave transformation
Elemental Adept Feat. (Force ignores resistance to Lightning dmg)?
Given wall of ice for now.

### Dungeon look
Apparatus lets them enter potion room, but they can brute force their way into main room?

## Escape
Activating Wave now?
What happens on the way back? Planar travel? How?
Androsphinx lair needs a arcane energy lock. Needs to gradually cast spells on it.
Fifth element style?
