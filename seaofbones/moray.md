# Moray
The isle of Moray outside the Moonshae isles. Contains the [[mirror-temple]].

They crashed onto it in [[32-stranded-on-moray]].
Quartermaster talks about needing tar to improve fixing process. Plus green fibers found inside the ship.

## Island
Large craggy, mountainous island, largely abandoned.

Old lady on the mountain side (spirit)
Cameron there (stowaway on artemis – wearing clothes matching the green fibers)

## Crashing onto island
Heavy Weather.
> See bow dip down and up over 10s period of huge clashing waves.
> As you are about to dip down. Lightning strikes, and suddenly you see it. Land is right in front of you.
*soft crash onto shore*
- Crew mutinies.
- I admit being your pirate crew has been a real pleasure. A real pleasure. But we've grown restless.
- We can hear the voice a' the siren callin' ta us and she say she be wantin' to do her hair! (going back to be barbers)

### Mordecai Intro Chat
[[artemis]] requires fixup. They can explore and look for tar/lotion.

- Aye. We'll be sailing back to the Sword Coast just as soon as we can fix the ship.
- Reconsider? Aye lad, we all agreed. We'd rather be cutting hair than cutting throats.
- Threat to kill? Of course you will laddie. BTW have you got any duct tape laddie? We're reattaching the mainsail. Shame, guess we'll have to use nails then.
- Repairs? Plenty of lumber on this island so we'll be able to repair all the major holes in the hull.
- We'll also be addin' a hardwood dance floor on the lido deck. (Something we've been talking abou for a while).
- Bottle of lotion. Sure to be needing it. Carpentry in this tropical climate can and will prematurely age yer skin. Tis but one of the many hardships a pirate must face daily during this barbarous age.
- If we pirates didn't carry hand lotion aboard all our ships, we'd probably die from the chafing.
- (A+ History fact – gets you into the college of your choice)
- Deal for lotion: Ship leaky as colander. And for some unknown reason, the ship's supplies of tar have been depleted. How the previous crew could ever set sail without any tar aboard eludes me.
- But the fact is, unless we get us some tar or something like it, we're doomed to this island for good.
- Give ye the whole booming bottle of lotion, if ya could find me something to patch the ship so we can be on our way home.

## Idea
### Outer temple
Mirror path
Cameron chats
Monsters innocuous..
Kitsune: 236 CC  (fey creature) walks around one area in fox form
Alternatively she can be a Simurg (similar but flying wolf) CC339
But actually spirit messenger (old lady)
What does she have?
Phantoms: 296CC (CR1) - easy, but can frighten them

### Inner temple
warnings and lashing out from Hergatha
Awaken spells can awake a Razorleaf p317cc
No reason to fight them, they can just leave, and they won't follow.
Eventually she stops obstructing
Defeat the big eye? Beholder!
How to fight when imprisoned?
Everyone freed after beholder.

Can make their way down to the main temple.
Power up Wave.

### Post Powerup
Final confrontation with Hergatha.
Have to defeat her to leave.
Can leave her behind for fear immunity, but loose ogremoch
Can side with her for other goodies.

### Escape?
Storm lord from CC chase?

## Initial Alma meeting
> You see the old lady from below the city.

"Well, I didn't expect to see you here. I'm glad you're still in one piece.
I see you've made it past the trackless sea. Did you meet Mordecai?"
Laugh in response...
"That sounds like a fun morning."
"Mordecai is a lost soul, dear."
"That ship is much more than just a ship to him."
"Don't make him your project."
YOU CRAZY?
"Y'know, you're not the first person to say that."
"Maybe you're right. LAUGH. How would I know if I were crazy.."
"The way I see it, the temple can't bring out anything that isn't already in you."
"But you gotta be a few crows short of a murder to live up here in the first place, right?"
"Oh, I'm just rambling like the old bat I am."
"Are you ready to give up? I know a shortcut back to the shore."

Stubbonrness:
"Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between stubbornness and determination, isn't it."
"You remind me of yourself when I was young."
"Good luck, and mind the wild."

VISITORS?
"Can't say that I get any, no. I don't mind solitude though."
"Mordecai needs to move on from that ship. But it's not going to happen on your schedule."
"And it doesn't help that you've got something to prove."

ALL ALONE?
"I got friends dear. I may be crazy, but I'm not a hermit."
"When I was younger I couldn't imagine staying in one place for this long. But then I found this temple."
"I knew right away that it would be my home."

WHY? WHATS SPECIAL?
"The temple shows who you really are. Whether you are ready for it or not. It keeps me honest."

### Gondola?
[[cameron]] could do his Gondola scene there.
