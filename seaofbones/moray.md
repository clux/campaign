# Moray
The isle of Moray outside the Moonshae isles. Contains the [[mirror-temple]].

They crashed onto it in [[32-stranded-on-moray]].
Quartermaster talks about needing tar to improve fixing process. Plus green fibers found inside the ship.

## Island
Large craggy, mountainous island, largely abandoned.

Old lady on the mountain side (spirit)
Cameron there (stowaway on artemis â€“ wearing clothes matching the green fibers)

## Idea
### Outer temple
Mirror path
Theo chats
Monsters innocuous..
Kitsune: 236 CC  (fey creature) walks around one area in fox form
Alternatively she can be a Simurg (similar but flying wolf) CC339
But actually spirit messenger (old lady)
What does she have?
Phantoms: 296CC (CR1) - easy, but can frighten them

### Inner temple
warnings and lashing out from Hergatha
Awaken spells can awake a Razorleaf p317cc
No reason to fight them, they can just leave, and they won't follow.
Eventually she stops obstructing
Defeat the big eye? Beholder!
How to fight when imprisoned?
Everyone freed after beholder.

Can make their way down to the main temple.
Power up Wave.

### Post Powerup
Final confrontation with Hergatha.
Have to defeat her to leave.
Can leave her behind for fear immunity, but loose ogremoch
Can side with her for other goodies.

### Escape?
Storm lord from CC chase?
