Used to operate out of Luskan + NW. Some of the big cheeses remaining on the Island of Ruathym.
They could've spotted it when they passed Ruathym isle in the sea, but now they have to gain renown in the Tower of the Arcane in [[luskan]].

## Motivation
Wizard piracy. Secrecy. They in fact have the remains of Isz' ship. Lives off the sea in general.
Remnants of the Brotherhood. They use old and forgotten forms of magic to protect themselves.
They know CHRONOMANCY! WHY?
Paradoxical summons showcase with a diamond. (Party trick)
Quicken thoughts (eyes jitter back and forth) - Charisma ADV.

## Lines
No one can see the future. I can see options and trajectories. Time is like a river. That splits into creeks or pools into lakes, or careens down waterfalls. I have the map, and I steer the ship.

## Location
Enclosed by mountains of all sides, many smaller ships. Illusion magic keeping the place from being visible. But if they break through they'll find the small village of Diyun
Subarctic climate. Trees and unpopulated on lower parts.

Inn

Wizards are in **The Temple of Aspiration**

## Population
200 mostly humans, some gnomes. Some goblin slaves fishing by the shoreline.

### Main party:
- Akvius - triton bard
- Therlahne – half-elf ranger
- Baroness Daeroris – Shadar-kai sorcerer
- Baron Yenumo – Human wizard (chrono)

**Complication 1**
If they encounter the place and board, they'll be led to the leaders of the island (but friendly façade, there's an in where they can rest and sleep, beer, fish + seaweed).
=> Wizard show down.

**Complication 2**
If they are spotted getting close to the island, a ship with them will pursue.
Sail of the arcane brotherhood.
