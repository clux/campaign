## Locating it
REQUIRES THEM SPOTTING THE GULL IN SAFE BY DAY
Read the text. They either need Find Familiar or Speak With Animals
[[virgil]] can then tell them where it is.

Alternatively, GooLock can cast Divination, Paladin can possibly also ask.
Survival check on Barb who's good at sea.
Gull can guide them to helmet that lets them speak with Animals?
INT20 history might also work...

## Water
Schools of fish on way down.
Dark Ambient Hour Meditations - Circumference (4 Hz Theta Binaural Ambience): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ch-HHGuzwRU
Remember pressure capsules (found on [[firewatch-island]].)

## If scouring floor:
Other creatures. Schools of fish. 10 hunter sharks. 1 giant deus ex shark. Undead patrol eventually.
Or ancient warning: Slab with runes.

## Pit of hatred
2 miles out, gull virgil can guide them. 300ft deep
UNDERWATER COMBAT (disadv on melee weapon attack, can't ranged melee unless crossbow,net,or thrown like javelin (then only disadv))

Read BLURB. NOT ROTTING

- (DC19 protected) hallow spell (5)
- DC16 con save vs 4d8 cold dmg (half on save).
- DC16 save vs vuln to necrotic on first enter.

Two groups of undead outside? Encourage stealth, or entering through the hole.

## Ship Battle
- 3x drowned blades CR2
- 1x drowned ascetic
- 1x drowned assassin

(This is easy for lvl11, can bump a little, +2 AC on BLADES/ASCETICS, +5speed, +2 all dmg rolls)
(These come back on the way to the shore – attach as characters enter wreck – do not pursue).
THESE ARE ON PATROL AROUND THE SHIP. Likely battle but can steatlth in.

5,000 SP, 2,850 GP, 120 PP. 10 jade pieces (100gp) in CHEST.

CAVERN LEADS DOWN INTO A RIFT. LIGHTS.
READ BLURB. NOT FROM CAVERN, FURTHER INSIDE SHIP

## Rift
READ SYRGAUL BLURB FROM MONSTER PAGE (FIRST PARAGRAPH)
Drowned master CR9 Syrgaul + 2/3 assassins CR4/5
He needs minions if they are fighting him..

The Ink (bluerot + 6d8 necro dmg is solid tho, but DC15..)
HE CAN ONESHOT PARTY MEMBERS WITH TENTACLE. DC15 CON save vs 2d6+3 necro.

We could just CR11 scale him with DMG.. (==25% more HP, +1 to hit/save dc/ac, extra sword attack, adv on wis saves, dex save prof) blue blood.

Or add 2 more blades..

### Battle features
Light from hole. Can be diminished with creativity? Will weaken

### Treasure
Head of Syrgaul (magic, locate nearest ship)

### Lines
- Come back for more have you. Let's hope you can do better than last time.
- You are not worthy of this power.

### Sealing
- Need sovereign glue? WhereTF was this? Orolan's chamber say..
- Stone shape can work.

### HOOK
They can also descend super carefully (but covered in water atm..) slow descend into illi colony that will lead to something for Izs.

### Reward for Zed
- Boots of False Tracks (from Assassin)
- +1 frostbrand greatsword
