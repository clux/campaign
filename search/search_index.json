He is called \u201cFreddie\u201d. He calls Freddie off.</li> <li>Kiaransalee - killed 600 years ago in Netherese empire, strong charm: couldn\u2019t be charmed, transformed     Defeated by:<ul> <li>Sunwuko - champion of the monkey king</li> <li>Shario - powerful mage</li> <li>Akkhan - Champion of Kavaki.</li> <li>Natalya - Mage</li> <li>They distributed relics of her body (eternal star, diamond, pommel/staff/rod of scythe. \u201cSigh\u201d - taken to waterdeep. The handle is stored in gilgrin (hidden behind the statue of the matriarch)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Dragon Nursery underneath Gilpengrin in a small abandoned purple worm nest</li> <li>He\u2019ll defo help us if we bring him his dragon-spawn. Also he\u2019ll give Goatweaver more strength if we help him out.</li> <li>Dragon is called Felgolos, has been here for hundreds of years</li> <li>We return \u201cgolden scourge\u201d and dragon statuette to Felgolos</li> <li>Magic barrier is keeping Felgolos to the centre and west of fortress</li> <li>Giant statue of a female drow (matriarch or priestess)</li> <li>We see another tomb, for Urum Emberbeer</li> <li>We come back to that place with the statue of the giant drow priestess, and try to go through a door on the left of the statue. The statue FRIGGIN WAKES UP AND IS PISSED, and attacks us with crazy magic javelins. Goatweaver takes time to destroy the stone pedestal holding a magical ruby. The ruby still floats in the air because of red energy beam. Destroying its pedestal does nothing.</li> <li>Faey finds a pair of bracers with elven writing in a chest</li> <li>Goatweaver realises the statue is undead and goes to town on it</li> <li>In the other chests: Wand with topaz crystal, crystal flask with metal liquid and some gems</li> </ul> <p>28/04</p> <ul> <li>Teleport gizmo has powered down, maybe recharging</li> <li>We walk into a fortress (which is behind Gilgrin)</li> <li>Door with a barricade and written warning about a dwarf in Giant</li> <li>There\u2019s a room with a tomb and a statue of a god with a spear through it\u2019s face</li> <li>Mordai defabricates the statue\u2019s head, allowing Faey to pull the \u201cspear\u201d out (which is actually a hammer)</li> <li>It\u2019s a Hammer of Thunder and it\u2019s super-heavy</li> <li>We hear footsteps. It\u2019s fire giants</li> <li>Mordai/Goatweaver fly over carrying Faey</li> <li>Faey drops on their head, battle ensues.</li> <li>We kill them and hide their bodies in Lava</li> <li>Navigating over Lava-ducts, we find a room with a forge</li> <li>Goatweaver takes some magic giant weapons (into the bag), walks out, wakes up the forge</li> <li>Forge: \u201cPassword?\u201d, Goatweaver (in Giant): \u201cFriend\u201d, Persuasion check: 11 vs -3, Goatweaver makes a friend</li> <li>Dwarf named Akkhan (the biggest, both in stature and in metaphorical greatness, dwarven king), a champion of Kavaki. Is from ~600 years ago. He knew a bunch of cool spells with radiant energy, like \u201cCondemnation\u201d, but the book isn\u2019t descriptive enough to learn it</li> <li>We find a statue of a platinum dragon (Bahamut) and an 800-year old book of famous dragons</li> <li>There\u2019s barrels full of fresh food (non-magical), so there may be someone living here</li> <li> </li> </ul> <p>21/04</p> <ul> <li>Gluedon tells us the King of Frost Giant\u2019s teleportation gizmo takes us to a \u201csecurity chamber\u201d, which is guarded by a \u201cconstruct\u201d which prevents us from leaving with any items (it doesn\u2019t seem dangerous). It has a key to the vault.</li> <li>There is a vault at the \u201cheart of Gilgrin\u201d (Umnos sealed it a long time ago)</li> <li>The elevator stops above the spires in Gilgrin near the roof</li> <li>We need to step into the teleport to activate it</li> <li>The hammer of Grimmin is in the Vault! (Alledgedly)</li> <li>We talk to Eilos the health minister. He\u2019s got a full-on hydroponics setup to grow giant vegetables and, we assume, copious amounts of weed.</li> <li>Eilos has a theory about mind control. They got an ice giant and checked him. He got the mind control like they hadn\u2019t seen since the drow. An \u201caboleth\u201d (large tentacle-like creature like a giant octopus but with much fewer tentacles and the mouth of a lamprey eel, mostly found in water) have the most potent mind control magic. There\u2019s a diagram from his book, which I assume is \u201cMind control for Dummies\u201d, that shows them squeezed into a less-than-10ft-diameter tube where we like only see eyes. It compresses really well, like an octopus, or a text file with lots of repetition.</li> <li>Harfeus (ministry of defence) monitors the magical alarms that we apparently triggered all around the place. He saw us on giants CCTV. He then quizzes us on us using the giants magical artefacts from the Vault; he\u2019s not keen because they\u2019re like super good at killing giants, and he\u2019s a giant. We let him know that we\u2019re only after the evil, not after giants.</li> <li>Storm giants don\u2019t have CCTV though, so we can probably sneak.</li> <li>Storm giants can both fly and ride dragons (!!) - they\u2019re pretty buff</li> <li>We go back to Rhymees and sneak through the King\u2019s bedroom</li> <li>Mordai casts silence on a sleeping two-headed King</li> <li>Faey opens the chests and we find a magical 1-handed axe and vegetables</li> <li>Crystal room with a Jade door (magically sealed)</li> <li>There are hundreds of flying padlocks. Goatweaver opens them all, then forgets which key goes in which padlock.</li> <li>There is a corridor with a stone gargoyle</li> <li>Mordai goes through the corridor and it\u2019s an air lock to another chamber. There\u2019s a button in that chamber which resets the doors</li> <li>It\u2019s actually a metallic gargoyle</li> <li>WE SOLVE A PUZZLE INVOLVING LOCKS, CHESTS AND TRICKERY<ul> <li>Eirik secretly tricked us into doing key exchange</li> </ul> </li> <li>We unlock the Jade door with the Jade key</li> <li>It has another teleport gizmo, which we step through</li> <li>We appear on a platform in a pool of lava, looking at another fortress (not Gilgrin)</li> </ul> <p>14**/04**</p> <ul> <li>We follow the gentle lady\u2019s suggestion to go talk to the ice giants</li> <li>Hans sees us coming through, goes \u201chey what\u201d</li> <li>Hans also casts mass suggestion on us, and makes us realise the error of our ways. No need to talk to the giants!</li> <li>After much debate, we decide to go back and sneak around. We find some pretty cool direwolf pelts, and two \u201cgiants potions\u201d?</li> <li>Mordai grabs these green bracelets very keenly</li> <li>Faey goes for the chest, which opens and freezes his feet to the ground. Mordai helpfully bonfires his feet, and Faey</li> <li>We follow the passage and find a corridor heading to a room with statues of different types of Giant (Fire, Frost, Storm and Cloud). In the middle is a plinth with a small hole and some glyphs written in giant:<ul> <li>to the very left: Gilgrin</li> <li>the one between left &amp; middle: currently pressed, says Rhymees (where we are)</li> <li>the one in the middle: a sort of dome?</li> <li>to the very right: Halos</li> </ul> </li> <li>We put the blue gem in the gap with a small hole and the glyphs start glowing</li> <li>Brief detour back to the other side of the cavern. We find the bedroom of the King of the Frost Giants.</li> <li>It has a weird glowing teleport/minor gateway and a chest. Mordai acts sensibly and doesn\u2019t let us check the chest because \u201cit\u2019s dangerous\u201d</li> <li>We press \u201cHalos\u201d and move upwards 5ft/sec. But we don\u2019t make it all the way to that level :(</li> <li>The lift stops at the \u201cdome level\u201d, we sneak round and jump through a temporary hole in the door.</li> <li>We meet Harfeus, minister of defence. He\u2019s got a green aura and he\u2019s nice. We tell him our story.</li> <li>Said we should talk to Gluedon. He was the architect of the spine. He\u2019s \u201cstrange but knows his stuff\u201d.</li> <li>Cloud giants are trapped on their level (Umnos has no need for them any more).</li> <li>Something happened to the lift, so the Cloud Giants haven\u2019t heard from the Storm Giants for a while</li> <li>\u201cHalos\u201d is the most heavily guarded place in all of Toril</li> <li>Gluedon (ministry of wizardry), Eilos (ministry of Health), Dogsag (ministry of Commerce)</li> <li>Lift stops at Gilgrin (Fire Giant fortress) behind the fortress.</li> <li>Umnos is the leader of the Storm Giants (aka Fracto-nimbuli, \u201cbecause he can split open the sky\u201d). They are bypassing the Cloud Giants now.</li> <li>There are spiral staircases up to Halos (guarded by storm giants who are on shoot-first-ask-questions-later policy, even with their cloud giants pals)</li> <li>Haven\u2019t heard from Queen Nehri (storm giants) for a while either</li> <li>We go to visit Gluedon. He\u2019s old. He built the spire, sort of. He wanted it used for good, but times, they\u2019re a-changin\u2019.</li> <li>\u201cHow can we close the portal?\u201d Well there\u2019s so many bad creatures out already, it might be a bit late for that. But also yeah it\u2019s still open so not good.</li> <li>We ask him about the lich. He doesn\u2019t know what a lich is. He browses his books.</li> <li>We ask about the mind control. It\u2019s the spine itself (!) that is being used for this.</li> <li>There\u2019s another crystal at the top of Halos, which can function on it\u2019s own (not at full strength). It might just be keeping the gates/portal open.</li> <li>The walls of Luskan have been breached by gnolls</li> <li>We see a giant-ass white dragon, guarding the bridges going up to the flying rock (Halos). He\u2019s called Fr\u00fcgt. He lives on another smaller floating island.</li> <li>Two places in the citadel to get some more weapons: Halos, and the Vault of Gilgrin</li> </ul> <p>07/04</p> <ul> <li>Fairy tale book about evil dwarves - Grimmin\u2019s hammer</li> <li>No input on dice roll</li> <li>A mammoth is basically a big bird</li> <li>We send Petros, everything seems ok, he scouts. We then follow along, invisible. We see the green giantess at the end of the hall, whispering to the two-headed marquess.</li> <li>Petros is \u201ctechnically dead\u201d, but he saw the door!</li> <li>We decide to go for the right, put out a round of silence at the left of the room, and try and kill these three giants on the right!</li> <li>We change two of them into turtles. We kill the third one. We crit roast a turtle on the fire. Then it turns back into a frost giant, as you do, and we kill it too. The third turtle, we bash, and when it changes back, the giant we trash.</li> <li>One of them had the key to the door, so we loot it and open the doorrrrrr!</li> <li>There\u2019s an ice lake, and a teal magical light in the ice, and the green giant!!! We do some good bashing. And very much like Greemin the Evil Dwarf, we slay the giant.</li> <li>We see a white spirit rise, tell us we\u2019re in an area of lockdown and charms us then disappears\u2026 WHAT</li> <li>She said \u201cstop you caused enough trouble already, why don\u2019t you go back and talk to the frost giants\u201d</li> </ul> <p>31/03</p> <ul> <li>We sneak (totally successfully) past the giants to another set of caves</li> <li>We meet the frozen body (and disembodied spirit) of Herksak, Marquess to Hjak Terval (sp??)</li> <li> <p>He tells us a new marquess arrived! <sub>~Green</sub>~Frost, two heads, came from the top, as the new leader. Then Herksak got backstabbed. The green giant can control minds. There was also a medium female, but Herksak didn\u2019t know who they are </p> </li> <li> <p>Most giants got turned rather than killed, and now serve that new marquess.</p> </li> <li>If we bring the green giant\u2019s bracers, then Herksak will show us the way to his keep</li> <li> <p>Update: the green giant is actually a \u201cher\u201d: </p> </li> <li> <p>We sneak back to Sansuri. Mordai does something and a hand of his comes out of the ether and drops the green giants\u2019 bracers (?!?). We bring them to Hergsak, he\u2019s happy and tells us the secret passage to the giants\u2019 sleeping chambers. Then he disappears with the bracers, but we find a Frost-Jade Pommel</p> </li> </ul> <p>24/03</p> <ul> <li>Remote session! All is black, despite darkvision</li> <li>Brechta fiddles with her thread, tells \u201cHans\u201d that his time is all messed up. H asks about learning more about his fate. Answer: his fate is his own problem, but something is messing with it. He gets a bonus question, though! She is surprised that she cannot answer.</li> <li>Goatweaver want to know if rope can be fixed. The rope is not magic.</li> <li>Brechta learns what a mountain is from goatweaver</li> <li>We are shown the lightningy part of the mountain where the evil lives, and told to \u201cstop the lich\u201d. There are several mountains that join to form a single spire.</li> <li>What\u2019s the name of the lich? \u201cIrae T'sarran, she\u2019s old, 200 years, Drow priestess\u201d</li> <li>Is the same lich as under the sea? Maybe</li> <li>How to we undo the magic? Can\u2019t but maybe can see.</li> <li>We go back to the city for teleportation purposes</li> <li>Acorn negotiation - deer hold up their end of the bargain.</li> <li>Hans sasses Isteria about her drinking, then asks her for teleportation. Faey is asked to bring back something nice, but she doesn\u2019t really care.</li> <li>We teleport back to the hill giant house, and solid snake it into the frost hall</li> <li>We meet up with Sansuri again and Mordai finds Petros (Queen Nehri - storm giant, part of protectorate, ally), (Marquis Hrrksag, Frost giant, ally)</li> <li>Protectorate has a large archive of history, and provide instruction to lesser giants</li> <li>We sneak up into frost giant land and prevaricate on how to get into a fortress past two guards. Whilst snooping around we come across two young frost dragons who are obliterated, and we take their our gold</li> </ul> <p>10/03</p> <ul> <li>Flashback: GW in the valley, feeling no shame</li> <li>GW sees frost giants walking away, and some spectral footprints going west. Frost giants ask GW who his owner is. GW cannot bullshit for shit. Cold food good.</li> <li>GW reaches a large stone door with horns on the side, and a tear shaped hole. A valkyrie with long plait greets him. This place is for children. GW is not a child. Awkward.</li> <li>The philosophy of Kavaki is simple: very long sentence about living simply</li> <li>GW must determine who is morally right in several situations. He enters a bar, and sees a couple having a good time. Someone steals some moneybags! GW calls them a thief and tackles them. GW tells them off.</li> <li>Next room, a kid bows down to an infernal creature. The infernal gives a gemstone to the child. The devil is red! But also, red in a deeper way. \u201cHey kid, not doing anything dark artsy, are you?\u201d \u201cWho\u2019s that devilly looking guy you\u2019re praying to?\u201d stahp. why not maul stuff instead of sacrificing your brother. stay in school. GW offers to beat up some children. GW mauls the illusory devil in the face.</li> <li>\u201cI have a theory\u201d. \u201cblue, white, green = good\u201d, \u201cred, orange and to a lesser degree pink = evil colours\u201d \u201cyellow, not sure\u201d. \u201cPurple, not sure.\u201d</li> <li>Woman tells GW he probably shouldn\u2019t just maul shit because its red. Red and blue are the only real colours.</li> <li>New challenge! Birds eye view of house. Child with green blade, planning to murder father, flashes red. Father is drunk, holding a knife, cussing out the child. The father is red too, oh no what a quandry, whatever will GW do? He bangs on the door, \u201cHAVE YOU HEARD OF OUR LORD AND SAVIOUR KAVAKI.\u201d GW provides relationship counselling to father and son on doorstep. \u201cI\u2019m also your friend. I\u2019m everybody\u2019s friend.\u201d GW attempts to convince the child to take up baking instead of beating up people at school. And also worship Kavaki.</li> <li>Valkyrie is impressed that GW didn\u2019t maul anyone in the face. GW now must prove his strength by fighting.  She summons some wolves. GW just misty steps up and grabs her. \u201cI maul her in the face\u201d. Flo forgets about all his modifiers and still kills her. She revives and is impressed.</li> <li>GW gets a protective paladin barrier that is orange. \u201cI guess orange is good now.\u201d Plus one time Valkyrie battlecall. \u201cHelfyuttur\u201d.</li> <li>Kavaki lives on mount Elysium.</li> <li>GW gives her a childrens book as a teleportation focus to find the rest of us. This will totally work.</li> <li>GW falls into T****he W****hole T****urtle S****ituation**\u2122\ufe0f**</li> <li>Hans misses the teleportation circle and teleports us in the air. Everyone\u2019s giant costume drops except for Faey\u2019s.</li> <li>There are large crystal topped mountains, a lake below, a city nearby. Mithran Dane. Delicate archways of marble etcetera.</li> <li>Faey and Hans once spent a weekend here and ended up staying for six months</li> <li>\u201cEvery went exactly almost to plan\u201d</li> <li>An elf hops up and tries to punch Faey in the face. Hahaha good laughs, yes. Old friend. Thaeyros.</li> <li>Thaeyros is a right shit.</li> <li>Mordai tries to blast some flowers. GW mauls a flower.</li> <li>Faey\u2019s friend Isteria, runs up, no punch. She claims he left a few days ago, actually it has been months. Elves are unimpressed by Faey and Hans\u2019 exploits. Pretty boring stuff, guys.</li> <li>Isteria calls Hans \u201cHanir\u201d. Mordai is shocked, but fails to talk to Hans because message is borked.</li> <li>GW is unimpressed by moral relativity of elves.</li> <li>Elves are keen to feed GW some smelly brown stuff between chicken thighs because Faey told them he eats anything. \u201cFresh fertiliser\u201d. UMAMI FLAVOUR. GW eats it. Umami is questionable.</li> <li>Everyone else gets some fancy bees and stuff \u2026sandwiched between two chicken thighs.</li> <li>GW is given a blue cocktail and it guilted into drinking it instead of beer. It tastes great. Too great. Fairy dust great. Hans would also like some crack, but his tolerance is too high to enjoy it. GW starts tripping balls.</li> <li>Faey and Mordai drink the green stuff instead.</li> <li>We are given some fancy beetle desserts, GW gets a blue flower and some bumblebees and a shit load of fairy dust. Still holding it together, though. Elves, including Faey, try to get him to eat a broth containg a brick of lard. GW eats the crunchy lard. Clouds leave his mouth.</li> <li>GOLIATHS HAVE STOMACHS OF STEEL</li> <li>Brechta the seer lives far away, and might be able to help</li> <li>Some rooms are made for us from a tree.</li> <li>GW uses his old face as a sleeping facemask.</li> <li>In the morning, GW asks for porridge. Faey fails to get fairy dust added</li> <li>Elven helper refers to Hans as \u201cMaster Hanir\u201d</li> <li>Mordai is shocked again and asks Hans</li> <li>Hanir is just the formal form of Hans\u2019 name. Faey and Hans are confused as to why Mordai is confused</li> <li>Mordai never noticed that Hans is an Aasimar</li> <li>Hans and Mordai\u2019s Hanir had the same staff. Dun dun duuun.</li> <li>Hanir is weirded out by being the same Hanir as before</li> <li>We head off to see the seer</li> <li>Everyone upsets the reindeer - turns out the reindeer hate being ridden by the elves. It is demeaning, but they will do it for acorns.</li> <li>Goatweaver gets to ride Gregor because he is the biggest. Gregor is pretty fucked off at the other deer for suggesting this.</li> <li>The deer take us somewhere near the equivalent of the spine of the world. There are some plant creatures that come to meet us. Faey asks them to move away, and they do. Gregor still ain\u2019t coming, though.</li> <li>Brechta is unsurprised to see us. She sits on a spinning wheel. The threads are shiny.</li> <li>Goatweaver gifts \u2026a crowbar. Brechta loves it. LOVES IT.</li> <li>\u201cIs purple evil?\u201d<ul> <li>A TOTAL CROWBAR LEVEL QUESTION</li> <li>86% evil - FACT</li> </ul> </li> <li>\u201cHow can I see my god?\u201d<ul> <li>\u2026he needs to die</li> </ul> </li> <li>\u201cIs he him from the past him from the future?\u201d points at Hans</li> </ul> <p>25/02</p> <ul> <li>Cloud giant is visiting home, and family are being dicks</li> <li>Fire giants below might have something to do with the whispering influence (leader is Soltan, who has hellhounds and an unknown powerful ally)</li> <li>Sansuri, Countess of the Boreal valley (talk to husband - Jarl)</li> <li>Everyone\u2019s a gangster until sunbeam gives you cancer</li> <li>Faey goes to stealth out the downstairs giant fortress</li> <li>Hjarka conveniently can speak giant in this specific location, but isn\u2019t here</li> <li>We turn into fire giants: Jasvir, Elsiar, Mmaaffaass</li> <li>Hans/Mmaafaasss makes iron to bring to the fortress</li> <li>They expected us to come from Ironslag? Slagforge?</li> <li>There is a giant wheel being driven by hobgoblins</li> <li>Mordai/Jasvir chads his way past all the guards</li> <li>The shiniest, beardiest giant is on top with a giant electric ball and a blackscale shield giant</li> <li>We spend ages thinking of a great plan, then do the dumb thing and just attack them</li> <li>Eirik rolls three natural twenties in a row</li> <li>Dreadnought is now a turtle!</li> <li>Hans refuses to relinquish the turtle</li> <li>Four twenties: fuck the blue die</li> <li>The king is also a turtle!</li> <li>We fly one turtle to the ceiling, and drop it on the crystal, yeet the kingturtle, then planeshift the fuck out</li> <li>Dreadnought somehow is not dead</li> <li>We are now in the Feywild</li> </ul> <p>18/02</p> <ul> <li>Much discussion about tiny servants vs the force of a giant\u2019s anus</li> <li>We find some human captives, Faey and Pendle ignore them entirely<ul> <li>Boris, and four others</li> </ul> </li> <li>Ratty and Faey go through a door into the darkness and get punched by a smelly feral thing</li> <li>Mordai finds a map of the surrounding area on a giant</li> <li>There is a bone rattling creature that commands, somewhere</li> <li>We find some wolves in a pen, and talk to them obviously.

She satisfies revenge by installing increasingly effective cannons in the ships of those going to fight Rottingham, but still desires to see him safely return.</p> <p>As she laboriously lugs the heavy weaponry aboard ship after ship, she revels in the fear they may strike in Rottingham\u2019s icy heart.  As she returns to her home with chests of gold and jewels, she rejoices in the fact that Ren\u00e9, too, may have held them close.</p> <p>While the mother's true motivations are yet to be determined, you wonder how deep Kenny's capitalistic form of vengeance goes. With an entire sea worth of pirate treasure in his possession, perhaps it's not the child that needs support.</p> <p>And the greatest mystery of all yet remains: who is Bob?</p> <p>3/12</p> <ul> <li>last time\u2026<ul> <li>forced to sell murder sword</li> <li>gave lightning javelin for membership to thieves guild</li> <li>summoned devil who wants to monopolise the gem trade</li> <li>mages guild, they want them to lure the devil out or something</li> <li>devil\u2019s house, some mind-changing, some taking of the bag of fluffy friends :(</li> </ul> </li> <li>tasks:     [x] go talk to mages about things     [x] i guess we have to kill this greed devil     [x] get a boat and get out of dodge</li> <li>we buff up at the mages guild and head off to fight</li> <li>it\u2019s 7pm, not totally dark, we\u2019re \u201cquite far north and it\u2019s the summer\u201d</li> </ul> <p>Additional learnings: Spike also eats pears wrong</p> <p>2/26</p> <ul> <li>Alma, an old lady telling us we\u2019re gonna see some shit</li> <li>head down path, come to canyon with crashing sandstone waves</li> <li>glowing purple vines on the walls</li> <li>Cameron (\u201cCamCam420\u201d) the adventurer painting<ul> <li>they\u2019re BOTH in green jumpers?!</li> </ul> </li> <li>sphere of water, placing wave in the centre causes it to go down</li> <li>down to a sandstone city, a temple</li> <li>mirror with a version of me, but with blue and green light</li> <li>suddenly the mirror shatters and she is there</li> <li>she runs away, we run after</li> <li>she tries to convince me:<ul> <li>she\u2019s a part of me, like my pragmatic side</li> <li>I should try to live a life of peace and leave this place and not pledge to any gods or anything</li> </ul> </li> <li>I\u2019m a bit stubborn about it<ul> <li>Wave gives me power, what is the alternative?</li> </ul> </li> <li>she is incorporeal, resistant to everything, and a chase begins<ul> <li>we climb up some vines, there are some mishaps</li> <li>Goatweaver eats a bat</li> <li>but we get out and she dissipates</li> </ul> </li> <li>we leave, CamCam is gone, Goatweaver takes the painting (I\u2019ve seen better)</li> <li>the old lady\u2019s house is just a front for what is clearly not a house</li> <li>I go back to the tavern to lie down and think about my life</li> <li>Goatweaver and Pendle go do this rake heist, successfully and comically</li> <li>it\u2019s a javelin of lightning - to keep it or not?</li> </ul> <p>Additional learnings: Flo eats pears by biting off their heads</p> <p>2/14</p> <ul> <li>Get to Waterdeep, protection aura</li> <li>dwarven temple is closed (Morden\u2019s)</li> <li>bustling flagon tavern</li> <li>tasks     [x] magic shop     [x] talk to Harbour Master Gurden for boat journeys     [x] mages guild?

Someone takes something from the future, and brings it to the past; that item now exists in a time loop. It must end up in the location in the future to be stolen, yet has no concrete origin. It causes a sharp break from its original history, both creation and future, and shunts the universe into an increasingly constrained pocket with no real history or surprises. - Where did the gold come from? No one knows anymore, our position in the multiverse is severed from the universe where the gold had a real origin. - Spent gold? Well, that gold has to find its way back. The universe will conspire to do so, and by doing so, it becomes ever more strangely deterministic. - Eventually the gold ends back with <code>Nihilant</code> until versions of yourselves are set to destroy him in about 50 years time.

You travelled with this assimar. - Every time you used your magic near him, he blacks out, or suffers catastrophic malfunctions of magic.</p> <p>Outro Hans (start) - He became aware of his future, and would go to any length to avoid it. - I had the tools to permute his future and lessen the destructive impact he would have on the timeline, and I simply gave him the opportunity (shuffles deck). - He was the perfect vessel for experimentation, because he represented the complete lack of determinism due to the unpredictable influence of chronomancy. - (cut to him having the deck while talking to a hooded grey female) But his resolve was strong. He would not take the chance. He would take any opportunity to fix his future/past (depending on how you look at it), and he placed his faith in the first god whose acolytes he met. - He got a cleric to take him to sea, in the hopes of Divine Intervention from the powers of Umberlee.</p> <p>Outro Hans (crazy shit) - I'm sure you're interested in how this ends. - (improvise sea attack by a boat - empress, and Hans' accident, plus Flames card) - (improvise cleric battling (unhood to reveal hjarka) failing battle with Pit Fiend, then Hans; Void, Fool Idiot) - Tried everything.

Pick the future one you want. One card in here (Moon w/Wishes) grants you the card to write your future as you see fit.\" - The cleric? Oh, her outcome is irrelevant for Hans. In this deck variations she saves Hans by sacrificing herself to fight the Pit Fiend. - Hanirs fate? Oh, he has to die. Everything you are doing and have been doing in the past (80 sessions) year depends on this. Any permutation where he lives, the world is in an unlivable state. - Changing something? Of course, we're in a state of Wish, I can do whatever we want. That said. Some things cannot be changed for your sanity. Destiny. - Change can't pertains to them. That would affect you and your encounter with Hanir, and then this encounter would not have happened. But that means you never tell young Hanir about his fate, and he goes on to create bigger time chaos with you. - Destiny: You need to meet Hanir, he needs to die, and he needs to die spectacularly enough for you to warn him of his fate. - Does he know they'll succeed.

Greater deity. Above kiaransalee by many levels. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gj2pwWZ5jTc</p> <p>She is the archetypal Matron Mother, reigning supreme over the other gods through trickery, fear, promises of power, or outright domination. Spiders are her sacred animals, for they weave treacherous snares and kill prey larger than themselves with cunning and poison. It was Lolth who convinced the primal elves to take on mortal bodies, and it is she who weaves the soul of each drow and spins the circumstances of their birth, giving strong-willed drow the chance to rise above their station and achieve greatness.</p> <p>She is a demanding mistress however, and what she demands above all are sacrifices of blood and treasure. However, the Dark Mother is also fickle in her favor and constantly tests her children \u2013 in one famous tale, she denies spells to a house\u2019s priestesses just as they commence attacking a rival, purely to see if they still had the strength or will to defeat them. Her mercurial demeanor and incessant demand for tribute may seem at odds, but Lolth is above all a goddess of ambition and selfishness, of chaos and caprice, one who preaches that might makes right and that rules exist only to serve those in power if they exist at all.</p> <p>While all drow fear losing Lolth\u2019s favor, so too do they know that if they can survive its sudden absence, then they never truly lost it at all. Chaos may be a pit \u2013 but true spiders can climb its walls.</p>"},{"location":"deities/lolth/#clergy","title":"Clergy","text":"<p>Priestesses in menzo. Matron mothers heads of houses all have priestesses.</p>"},{"location":"deities/lolth/#rebirth","title":"Rebirth","text":"<p>Drow do not experience Remembrance and dwell in darkness during Trance because Lolth reweaves their souls into new bodies upon death. Lolth purportedly does this so that every drow will live in the here-and-now, aware of their own uniqueness and the temporary and precious nature of this life. Incidentally, this existential fear makes drow heavily reliant on Lolth and her priestesses for protection in the treacherous Underdark, which surface elves would argue is the whole point. Legend has it that the drows' final repudiation of Corellon was when they mystically-bound their souls to Lolth in order to have their truly unique rebirth apart from Corellon; when Lolth was cast out by Corellon, they were banished from his presence too, eternally bound to Lolth, their creator and captor. As a result, many drow see no escape. Given what Lolth offers and permits, many do not wish to.</p> <p>Drow near-death experiences typically involve ringing; this heralds the presence of Kiaransalee, whose spectral form is covered in loose-fitting necklaces, rings, and arm-bands of purest silver. When a drow dies, the Revenancer springs into action, dragging the soul out of its mortal shell piecemeal back to the Demonweb Pits over a period of eight days, while Ghaunadaur feasts upon the soulless body. During this time, the deceased experiences ever-more terrifying visions as Lolth unspools its soul, day-by-day, hour-by-hour, and uses those threads to weave new drow souls.</p> <p>Within these eight days, spells such as raise dead can be used to abrogate Kiaransalee\u2019s claim to the soul in Lolth\u2019s name. However, returning from death is an ordeal, and whatever part of the soul that Lolth has already unwoven is not reclaimed; the harrowing visions and slow unravelling of the self often result in profound changes to one\u2019s personality. If the deceased is not raised within this time frame, far more powerful magics must be resorted to in order to bring them back. Spells such as resurrection or true resurrection beseech Lolth to reweave the soul of the deceased. Because Lolth knows what lies within the dark hearts of all her children, the drow brought back (inasmuch as they are \u201cbrought back\u201d) knows everything it knew in life and retains any and all skills it had at the time of its death, though such individuals are rarely identical to their former selves. Few priestesses will resort to such powerful magic, however, as they require a considerable investment in resources, and the inability to cast spells after a successful resurrection spell would put said priestess at considerable risk of being usurped by a rival.</p> <p>An afterlife does not exist in drow religion per-se. While a harrowing transitional period does exist as a soul is dragged bit by bit into the Demonweb Pits, it does not remain there for long or in one piece. Punishment or reward in the next life is entirely temporary and limited to the mortal sphere. However, Lolth is a fickle mistress, and while many believe that she can be placated or propitiated to provide a beneficial rebirth, there is no guarantee; the Spider Queen spins as she wills, according to no whim but her own. Because Lolth encourages the pursuit of sensual pleasures, power, and material wealth in this life, whilst simultaneously promising that nothing is guaranteed or carried over into the next one, her followers are fanatical in their devotion.</p>"},{"location":"deities/orcus/","title":"Orcus","text":"<p>Loosely based on https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/wiki/Orcus</p>"},{"location":"deities/orcus/#followers","title":"Followers","text":"<p>syrgaul + tameraut undead crew (wants to rule the seas)</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"deities/orcus/#undying-soul-attack","title":"Undying Soul Attack","text":"<p>Attacked by undying-soul in a rapid mage attack.

You see the visage of a gnoll 5 times the height of a regular gnoll. Twisted metal wrapped around its body, providing some kind of make-shift, masochistic armor (surly digging into its flesh). See the creature stomp its way through the city, with intent, heading towards the Tower Arcane at the middle of the river. It's smashing its flail up against the tree, penetrating some magical barrier as it does so, and using it to climb up the side of it, with impossible dexterity. You see mages up at at fortifications at some of the branches shooting fireballs and lightning bolts down, but it does not seem to give a thought to it at all. It takes it maybe 12s to scale 100ft and reach the battlements, swatting a selection mages with its flail, before it enters the brotherhood. Meanwhile gnolls rampaging through the city, it does not take long before this is a horror scene. Bodies everywhere, gnolls having their fill of guts. For the next 30 minutes you hear clashes of arcane magic from within the Tower.</p> <p>Before you notice (depowering sounds). The faint humm that was ever present in this city comes to a halt. Magical defenses around the tower cease. Fightining within the tower continues. and you fix your eyes up towards the balcony where you hear a counterspell interrupted, and after a crack, you suddenly see the familiar dark blue robes of Celerom, torn, his body flying through the air, lifeless and limp, crashing with full force down on the ground, sliding across the gravel with several large gashes and wounds across his legs neck and face.</p> <p>You peer up once again to the tower; and you see a figure in a dark cloak with yellow edges (arklem). You don't see a face, you just see smoke exude from a seemingly empty hood. The creature conjures up a lighting bolt from its arms (actually no arms), aiming down towards the crash site. But before unleashing it, just lowers its hands, then teleports.</p> <p>A minute later. Whoosh. The familiar sound of teleportation magic once more, but louder and more powerful. All the gnolls look to the sky, and in unison turn to face the battlements, and howl. They start stampeding out of Luskan and disappear beyond the castle walls. As their stampeding sound grow fainter, it's replaced with the remaining wails of humans slowly dying. It's a gruesome and agonizing sound.</p> <p>Next day; NO: You look up; the sky clouds separating to reveal two of toril's three moons stacked on top of each other in unison. Both are deep red (dual eclipse). YES: You look up; the clouds show a swirling torrent of yellow energy, Corellor Borealis, an elven figure descends from the sky. Scanning the battlefield with one metal plate with 8 red dots across it. While she appears almost angelic with her entry, you recognise her. This is Irae. She descends. \"This better work without the blade, or this will be a huge waste\" She notices the body of celerom, checks it, thinks for a bit. She tosses a weaker looking healing spell on him.</p> <p>Grasping her staff with both hands, the staff extends. You see the star.

Handholds are scarce on the treacherous walls, which can explode with flame or lightning at any moment. Rocky outcroppings come and go, collapsing or molding themselves as onlookers watch. All manner of plaguechanged creatures dwell in pockets and on precipices in the upper Chasm. Some climb the walls, and others (particularly those meant to attack the surface world) ride bolts of chaotic energy that flare from the bottom of the pit. These creatures rise like birds filling their wings with wind.</p> <p>Twisted Fane</p> <p>The upper reach bottoms out in a pitted wasteland of shattered rock that resembles broken glass of myriad colors. Energy flares up from this area at random intervals. The rock hums with energy, pulsing as though alive. Here, characters are literally standing on the plaguechanged warrens. At the center of the area stands a fortress of black rock seemingly molded like clay around a pulsing azure crystal. This edifice\u2014the so-called Twisted Fane\u2014seems to be the source of the chaotic energy swirling up from the Chasm. The crude, gargantuan gemstone swirls with power but otherwise has no discernible purpose. A colony of foulspawn (Monster Manual) dwells here, paying homage to the crystal as though it were a deity. The foulspawn protect the crystal at all costs, viciously attacking intruders without making an attempt to talk. If the characters search outside the fortress, a DC 26 Perception check reveals obscured tunnels that lead deeper into the earth, toward the true masters of the Chasm</p> <p>False Bottom</p> <p>A clever defense, the Twisted Fane is a red herring perpetuated by the aboleths. By all appearances, the fortress stands at the nadir of the Chasm and gives the impression that it is the source of the Spellplague energy that rises toward the surface. Upon closer inspection, a character who makes a DC 19 Arcana check finds that the azure crystal has no such power. The foulspawn dwell here to lend credence to the deception. They operate under the domination of the aboleths and wait as sword fodder for an attack. The aboleths\u2019 hope is that any enemies powerful enough to reach the bottom of the Chasm will slay the foulspawn, destroy the worthless crystal, and leave, thinking their task accomplished. Meanwhile, the aboleths can regroup and ready an attack on the foes who have now revealed themselves.</p>"},{"location":"north/neverwinter/#eba-stronghold","title":"EBA: Stronghold","text":"<p>True cost of Castle Never; 100k Wizard Tower (maxed wizard tower), with 30k Keep (3<sup>rd</sup> level) Build time of a year with full financing.

At this point there is no need for further violence. Our betrayers have been overthrown, and our plan has been set into motion.</p> <p>Irae (artifacts): You see, it's with all the artifacts of Kiaransalee combined that the raised dead retain their souls and sentience.</p> <p>Irae (on Kiaransalee): Lolth's betrayal of Kiaransalee and her proficiency for necromancy made her vengeful. Their society of constant competition is a deeply unhealthy one, that she opposed, and she had many followers. Ultimately, she went insane, and focused too heavily on simple conquest and revenge, her powers and ideology had potential. In the long term, however, there's no need for that type of barbarism. Irae (on drow soc expanded): To properly construct an empire, it requires giving the followers adequate rest and food, training, and equipment. If you treat them like enemies, they will not help you. The church of Lolth and its ideological hatred of their weaker made this type of cooperation impossible. Humiliating people who speak up by converting them into hideous monstrosities is a dead (weight) loss.</p> <p>\"It won't matter much now that menzo lies in ruin.\"</p> <p>Irae (on Menzo): All clerics sympathetic to Kiaransalee were evacuated before the portal to the abyss cracked open underneath their pathetic metropolis.</p> <p>Irae (demon lord defense): We needed to unite the dark seldarine once again under the banner of Kiaransalee. Doing this required a small amount of destruction.

I am stating our intent; a united, and prosperous seldarine, not built out of hatred, not based upon a society of constant exploitation and humilation. Do with that as you wish, but be aware, that no exchange of power, ever went without an initial violent conflict.</p> <p>Irae (on her position in the new society): I know what systems do not work for drow and undead, monarchs or rulers notwithstanding; and am all in favour of putting power into the hands of the people, if the people can be held accountable by the processes we instrument. As of where we stand, I would guess we are both largely disinterested in discussing various styles of government right now.</p> <p>Irae (undead sentience defense): You fail to understand the true significance of this event. It's all undead raised from this point by me, or anyone I have raised. This is an infectious proprety. Souls are no longer sent off to hell in eternal torment to serve as infernal currency, nor are a small percentage sent to elysium, where they can enjoy this.. distinct position of privilege. They are free. They are immortal. All it took was an economic crash in the currency of souls. Irae (on Bone City): It is unfortunate that you had to interfere, but you were not the only ones with the city in its crosshairs. From what I understand you obtained a better afterlife for those poor souls, and for that I thank you, but you also robbed them of their chances of immortality.</p> <p>Irae (on being a lich): Voluntary immortality is the highest form of existence that any creature should strive towards. Why should our mortal bodies' gradual decay, rob us of our cognitive abilities?

In fact, it was so unclear that the beholder stalks were still bouncing 30min later when ursula arrived. She noticed, and gave GW a whole schtick about good and evil.</p> <p>In the end, GW tries to use the Wand of orcus with the silence ritual cast. Goes in with a new mindset: trying to force the mace to be good. It's difficult, you do have some common goals, but it clearly wants to be taken back to \"The Black Depot\" (sic despot).</p> <p>Distributed rest of magic items, then went to give galeron the heads up about the situation.

Mordai first scry-suggested he'd speak out load, which was not super effective, so you sent GW and Faey to Waterdeep, past confused mages, to deal with him. You found he was smuggling drugs, so you did the morally just thing and stopped his operation, smashing his vials, and giving him 20gp to make him get up on his feet. It did not seem to be of relief for him however, so Faey stealthed a couple of rubies into his pockets.</p> <p>Anyway.

Goes into great deatils of the properties of the dracoliches. They all seem to have acid breaths, but there are some changes between them. Some of the dracoliches were focused so heavily on their pursuit to immortality that they could regenerate mid combat. Other were hardened by some magical armor that is powered by their own phylactery and were almost impossible to hit. Not quite sure what is useful information here. - Valindra: Also interestingly that the book has this part here where Edward is making a joke to her about killing a dragon rather than resurrecting, and she goes on this whole tirade and almost kills him right there. Really attached to her work in a psychotic way. - Larloch is the most odd one out of the bunch. A lich as well, went by the name <code>The Shadow King</code>, but regardless of his regal title, he did not come willingly. I.e. he was betrayed by Irae and Arklem. His fixation with trying to mend parts of his broken past empire may not have been the best for his sanity though, but at least he had a pet to get him through it.</p> <p>NOTES: - 16h passed (i think) - plan c: philter of love - lightning -&gt; green trigger (great for GW attacks) - Larloch's Ring: Cast Darkness (1 action) No attunement.

Key points you discussed; Larloch is the best for talking to (and whomst you also have partial coverage to his necro res), Irae's probably the hardest hitting one of the bunch with the scythes of the revenancer (whose dmg is a lot of necrotic), Validra could be the best for fighting (all of you have acid res, and she's weak to bludgeoning, but she also has immune to radiant). Unfortunately, your hand is forced as Diana tells you she's on the move.</p> <p>With Graycloaks distributed across the walls (and Gilbert in left tower), you see Kiaransalee approach.

Some of you get hit. GW manages to keep Kiaransalee in Larloch's purple form for most of the battle by taunting him about his past and his betrayal, which it doesn't look like he wants to believe, but whenever this happens his protective layers seem to drop a bit (immunity -&gt; resistance). The one time GW failed to keep Larloch's form, Valindra's form came out, and the acid cone melted the walls and opened a funnel for the remaining undead. It was also discovered that Valindra's form have much higher AC (despite being vulnerable to bludgeoning). You arrow down the undead matriarch and fireball down drow spectres, driders and finish of the undead bears with an Unstable Singularity. Faey is sniping things left and right, but does notice that Kiaransalee probably can see him, despite the invisibility.</p> <p>As we left off; Kiaransalee's purple form slams down near the archers; sends a black rippling Circle of Death through and gets herself some new undead helpers. Faey does 96 damage with some insane radiant crits Kiaransalee causing her to take to the skies towards you. GW charges in to stop and tries to keep Kiaransaleein in Larloch's form, but as the intimidation fails, the protective shell reforms once more.</p> <p>top of the round.... beam on faey (truesight + bad gw intimidate)...

Many blinks and monk moves back and forth leaves a lot of you out of range, and Faey at a really low HP after tanking two scythe attacks to the face.</p> <p>However, the many ranged hits starts to wear on her as she moves into the southern end of Neverwinter. Tearing up an arcane storm that lowers the sight range to 100ft and starts transforming the city.</p> <p>It takes you a few rounds until you realize you're in the Shadowfell, and it's the last you've seen of Larloch's form (incidentally all because of rolls).

He makes it. Goatweaver's getting low as well as he tries to tank for Mordai. Faey jumps down to launch the dragonstrike attack at her chest to push her away giving you some room to breathe.</p> <p>Then GW with 4hp? succeeds in casting Timestop from the Wand of orcus. Max roll on rounds. DBF, Potion of Heal, Cure Wounds, Cure Wounds, Taunt, Cure Wounds. Full round of Mauling into DBF detonating for a 260 points of damage.</p> <p>Irae's form staggers in disbelief.

She only gets healing in (Power Word: Heal though), but cannot change form. She is stuck as irae's form. In the next 3 rounds you reign down over 1000 points of radiant damage with a huge amount of crits (Faey with a 200 round), meanwhile she rolls 4 nat 1s to hit GW in a row, so that despite being the sole target of a god for 3 rounds, he's alive. At 1hp.</p> <p>Kiaransalee tries a desperate Tenser's Transformation. Doesn't heal because of spirit shroud. Tries more healing, doesn't work.

Once it was time to move beyond the small, secret group phase, their organization and beliefs worked against them. They believed, pretty earnestly, that all these people jumping on the bandwagon must be revolutionaries coming from their own secret groups, or at least have been converted to the idea of overthrowing the Emperor.

Membership kind 1: parties looking to ComIntern to be a participating member in a global communist movement without borders. Membership kind 2: actual ComIntern agents sent into the field to help the parties self-organise. The agents were under pressure from Soviet leaders to instill a paternalistic view of ComIntern (the others wouldn't work alone). The parties wanted to be equal members, but the soviets wanted affiliants. Agents stood in the middle. Tension played out in these conflicting goals. Some agents pressured to be heavy handed, leading to fractures. Tension played out in structure; agents assumed they'd be in charge even in countries they did not know. They knew theory (via Lenin/Marx directly even), but not practice (Quote from Mao). Mao could reach the average Chinese person through exeperience in revolution; how to fight mountain battles, plant and contact undercover agents. Stuff not covered by the Communist Manifesto. Secrecy; they were a giant boogeyman. Outside agenst coming in and starting a revolution? Set the stage for a later cold war. Stalin disbanded ComIntern before that. Secrecy was about what they were up to. Even the agents themselves did not understand where things were going. Backfired. Parties also felt a lack of cohesive movement from ComIntern. Parties couldn't trust advice and leadership when decisions were shrouded in mystery.

It may appear that way on the surface, but in actuality a lot of cults operate to entice the open minded. In psychology, Openness is a trait that people have and cults look for two traits among people to latch onto: People with high agreeability, and people with high openness, bonus points for people who are high in conscientiousness and by extent judgmental personalities. The reasons why cults seek these personality types out isn't a conscious thing, there isn't a mastermind controlling the cult in the real world, instead, these personality types seek the new way of thinking coupled with the community. Isolation is not necessarily intentional. this is the community wanting to stay a community. Cults, as in all members, do not like it when members leave, the fantasy of the cult, the community that protects them and transforms them to be more than what they are. So that thing that causes conflict within the community is an enemy. This is where Agreeability rears it's ugly side, like mama bear, she will rip you apart if you touch her cubs. No doubt you have met a person with high agreeability who will be kind and nurturing, but will be outright hostile to threats to their sensibilities. This is cult like behavior and it's how cults maintain themselves. Flexibility also due to community over belief. The belief is a vehicle, and if that belief is wrong then the community is shaken. This is why you will see cults attack criticism, it's not because they're disrupting their master plan, it's because you're threatening their perceived safety and unity. Innocense potential: Cult members are not evil, not even the leader (most times) They are more like adults who want to be children, they're sad and lost in the world and want to return to a safe place where mom and dad are at the wheel, driving the car with them in the back of the car.

It has to be the navy of course, because being on a ship makes the whole running away thing much harder to do.</p> <p>In fantasy however, we often see cases such as the Night's Watch in Game of Thrones or Grey Wardens in Dragon Age, which are organizations that take on criminals as a form of \"alternative punishment\". The criminal gets to avoid a harsher sentence, the organization gets another member, everyone is happy. While joining is not an official sentence, it amounts to the same when people join specifically in order to avoid such a sentence. In the case where Eddard Stark agreed to head to the Wall by Cersei's suggestion, conscription was to be used as an alternative form of exile.</p> <p>In real life the French Foreign Legion served a similar purpose by allowing people to join without any documentation or any questions asked, effectively giving anyone a fresh start... as long as they sign on for life.

Originally used as a magically synthesized antidepressant, Sundrop when consumed tricks the user into believing that they are happy, as it quite literally gives them \u2018warm feelings\u2019. Over usage may leave the user feeling withered between uses, as their dependency has rendered them unable to produce dopamine and serotonin. Over time users also commonly begin to build tolerances to Sundrop, requiring greater quantities to be consumed to maintain the effect. Overdosing on Sundrop causes feverish conditions, as the drug radiates through the users veins, ultimately burning them alive from the inside out.</li> <li>Blackroot: These black lichen tufts grows on large rocks and boulders found above timberline (the elevation at which trees do not have enough oxygen to grow). When chewed on, it causes the user to have a pleasant, tingling sensation of the lips, tongue, and gums. As well, it can give the user a sense of mental sharpness and alertness. If swallowed, it causes nausea and vomiting if the user fails a DC 13 Constitution check. If used for 1d6 hours continuously, the user must make a DC 15 Constitution check. If failed, they experience nausea, but if passed they gain advantage on Perception checks for the next 1d4 hours. Not inherently addictive, though if used for 1d12 days in a row, the user will feel extremely groggy if they do not use it every morning.</li> <li> <p>Drakeroot: Concentrated purple nectar of the mandrake plant. When you drink it, you go into a coma for 2 hours. During this coma, your outer layer of skin becomes more like a cocoon. At the end, you emerge with all health point fully restored and any scars gone. After 24 hours without another dose, you cannot heal using your hit die or over a long rest without using more Drakeroot. This continues until you break the addiction.</p> </li> <li> <p>Zaegoo: Harvested from a breed of gelatinous cube native to the colder regions, this teal jelly causes a biting cold sensation on the way down, but gives you immunity to cold damage and the ability to withstand cold climates for 3 hours.</p> </li> <li>Druidic Dream: A mostly benign pill made by druids and sold to whoever wishes to buy some. Its ingredients and manufacture are secrets the druids keep to themselves. When held under the tongue the pill puts the user in a mild state of giddyness similar to being a \u2018happy drunk\u2019 for 1d4 hours (DC13 con save for half, 19 to deny), followed by 1d4 hours of sleep with idyllic dreams. Addiction 1, 10%, nature.</li> <li>The Ladies\u2019 Love: Succubus sweat has pheromones meant to make men go crazy in bed. Some alchemists can potentialize this effect, making it stronger and longer lasting. When this paste is applied to the skin it removes all inhibitions from the user, as well as making them more selfish and straightforward. On males it causes them to become aroused and extra horny, while mildly improving their physical skills (+3 to str, dex and con). All effects last an hour. DC 16 charisma save denies. Addiction 1, demonic.</li> <li>Cyclops Tear: Taken by eating the powder. Causes your eyes to water a ludicrous amount. The tears produced are the main attraction of this drug. They taste perfect and are guaranteed to be the best thing you have and ever will taste, but the taste varies by the person. It also only tastes that way to the person whose tears it actually is. To everyone else it tastes like tears. Overdose causes one of your eyes to desiccate and fall out. Oddly enough, people with only one eye anyway are immune to this effect, so it is very popular among Cyclopes.</li> <li>Gorgon: Mushrooms, which are eaten raw or dried and powdered. Gorgon gives the user paralysis for a couple of hours and gives vivid hallucinations, which are somewhat controlled by the user like a lucid dream. Most of the time the experience is pleasant but people have been known to have some horrible trips. Most people will prepare before taking the drug and lie in bed or in a grassy field, but those with more desperate addictions can often been found collapsed in the streets, stone still except for rapid eye movement.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"rules/recreation/#cooking","title":"Cooking","text":"<p>Normally, we have food served by bizarro https://localcuisine.github.io/ generator.

They also build a 1-3<sup>rd</sup> level adventure idea based on a cult of masochists who slowly turn into beholder like features (maybe umberhulk origin story idea).</p> <p>Void is a dark and viscous substance, appearing as either deep blue, purple, or black depending on the lighting and the batch. If one looks closely at a vial of void, they might notice that it seems to move and swirl about of its own accord. Void is extremely addictive and is injected subcutaneously using a large metal syringe. Its viscosity often causes it to bubble out from the injection site, damaging surrounding tissues and creating large lesions on a user\u2019s arms. Due to the lack of disposable syringes, injection instruments are typically shared among several addicts. This leads to the spread of various diseases, most notably cackle fever, sewer plague, and sight rot.</p> <p>Beyond the uncanny resilience void grants, it is known for several other properties. Its primary feature is the euphoric highs users get. Users enter a dreamlike state, drawing upon heightened senses to help them experience the world as much more pleasing than it really is. A more disturbing property of void is the pleasure one derives from experiencing pain while high. Void addicts are effectively turned into masochists and have no fear of pain or damage to their bodies (they are often seen self-mutilating for pleasure). Void is also known to augment the brain\u2019s receptiveness to psychic energies, and this is thought to be the source of the hive-like tactics and mentality of the Grinners.</p> <p>Void begins to permanently alter the body after the first few months of addiction. These changes first manifest in the paling of the skin, which becomes clammy. Addicts also experience total hair loss and extreme loss of weight within the first few months. After some time, void begins to warp and disfigure the body. An addict\u2019s teeth will naturally sharpen, their skull shape might warp, their eyes may change sizes or colors separate of each other, and they might begin to become lopsided in their musculature. Reptilian-like eyes and bony protrusions are also common. Less common is the development of translucent skin, which reveals the addict\u2019s muscles, tissues, organs, and blood vessels underneath. Void also damages the brain in a process known as brain rot.</p> <p>Void hardens and expands into sharp protrusions when left at a cool temperature. Thus, it is always kept slightly warm. Void addicts who die in the cold are known to become immensely heavy and grow large crystalline spikes from their corpses.</p> <p>Void is incredibly dangerous to manufacture as it is distilled from beholder pus. Once a beholder is captured, it is injected with a cocktail of stimulants and sedatives that prevents it from sleeping or moving. The beholder\u2019s tongue is bolted to its bottom jaw, and its main eye is either removed or blinded. The eyes on each of its stalks are then impaled with a needle attatched to a large tube. These wounds are allowed to fester, generating large amounts of pus, blood, and fluid which are then pumped through the tubes into large distillery vats for processing. The pus is separated from other liquids and purified to become void.</p>"},{"location":"rules/recreation/#void-mechanics","title":"Void Mechanics","text":"<ul> <li>Delivery: Subcutaneous injection of 1ml of void is an effective dose.</li> <li>Addiction DC: Extremely addictive.

Brain Rot: for every 1d4 months a creature spends addicted to void, it must make a DC 15 constitution saving throw or permanently lose 1 point of intelligence as its brain is slowly liquified .</li> <li>Overdose: If a creature takes more than one dose of void less than 4 hours apart, it must make a DC 15 constitution saving throw or fall unconscious. If the creature fails the save by 5 or less, it is blinded permanently. If it fails the save by over 8, it dies.</li> <li>Withdrawals and Satiation: If an addict does not take void at least once every 14 hours, they begin cravings and hallucinations. The addict gains one level of exhaustion for every 24 hours it away from void. Instead of dying on level 6, a creature must roll 1d12 + 5. This determines the number of days the creature spends on exhaustion level 5. After the last day, the creature rolls a DC 12 constitution check. On a success, it recovers from its addiction (although it retains any modifications). On a failure, it becomes comatose or dies (DM\u2019s choice). There are possible ways to negate these effects, including magical therapy and alchemical solutions.</li> <li>Street Price: Void costs anywhere from 5sp to 5gp, depending on the buyer.

Effects on toxicity?</p> <p>If the adventurers were to look for it, they could notice the inside of the room doesn't look quite right, at a deeper observation: the texture of the objects in it isn't quite perfect, and it's very noticeable if touched. It also exudes its digestive juices at all times, even if in small and hard to notice quantities, they can be smelled or seen before the fight starts. In any case the room inside and outside is dimly lit, making all of that hard to notice. Spells that look for living creatures will obviously reveal the trap, and so will a deep examination of the entrance door: The mimic relies on the adventurers being too busy to pay attention, its fine details aren't quite perfect. Once the fight started, the mimic will attack with pseudopods trying to bash the heroes. The two fake adventurers and the fake mimic are in fact nothing more than that, fleshy extensions of the mimic, and they are pseudopods in themselves. Their swords not real metal. A very careful observer will notice the feet of the two are, very loosely, attacked to the floor with a fleshy filament under their boots. The room can spawn other, normal looking pseudopods to fight other adventurers if 3 aren't enough. The room also exudes acidic juices that can drip on people and do acid damage, they also rapidly coat the walls causing damage to any that touches them. In a few minutes, the room runs out of air and is filled with toxic gas. The door to the fake room turns into a jaw, and it's firmly locked, it is also made of flesh material and not wood making it much harder to break through, it is also coated in acid as well. Once the room has killed its victims, it will take a few days digesting them, any gear that can't be digested will be attacked to the fake adventurers to make them look more realistic for future traps. While digesting, the mimic is weakened and drowsy and the trap will not happen. The door will simply change shape to look like a section of wall, hiding the mimic room mimic.</p> <p>Counters?

Perhaps the mimic has a spot above it that doesn't drip acid. The adventurer(s) they party encounter are technically there... or they were. A week ago. This is just a ghost image, and when the party trigger the trap, it starts replaying the events that killed the other adventurers. The door is equally anti-corrosive. Adamantine would be great for both, as it wouldn't eat through that, most likely. The mimic shrinks at five feet /round. Interacting with the chest in any way causes the room mimic to shrink in another five feet / round. So you've got the walls moving inwards, an acid-dripping substance on them, a chest that doesn't seem to be trapped but won't open, and interacting with it just makes the walls close in faster.</p>"},{"location":"underdark/solas-domain/#challeng-3-childrens-fight-chamber","title":"Challeng 3: Children's Fight Chamber","text":"<p>No game no life fight.
