=> 20 per hit with lg res and rage
2 attack. Sentinel while riding.
LOTS OF HP IF HE CONSUMES FRYGGT 257+(162..504)
Leg 1: Riposte reaction attack. Add superiority dice to dmg.
Leg 1: Sweeping strike; hit both within reach, but LG dmg on bonus

Leg 2: Lightning lift; STR contest on HIT. Fail => extra leg action, lift SHOOT. 8d6 LG + 16 NECRO (44 with res). Then they are prone.
Leg 1: Pushing attack; 15ft on STR save fail DC24 - 2d8 bludgeoning.

MAKE ATTACKS COOL AND WIDE.

Special attacks; Call chain lightning. Weapon to heavens. (full action)

Always do 2 leg actions; (even if slowed => 4 attacks pr)
Haste cancels out slow except for one less leg action.
Crit once every other round. => one out of 8 hits does: 36 (26 with lg res)
If enemy backs off, he can parry shots with weapon when dodging.

E(DMG) = 20*3+26 + 2*20 + 15 + 10 = 151
(3 attcks, 1 crit, 2 sweep/riposte +thwave +push)
E_haste(DMG) = 20*5 +26 + 2*20 + 15 + 10 = 191
(5 attacks, 1 crit, same 4 leg actions)

## Fryggt; AC20
+14 to hit.
1x Bite 15ft 2d10+8 pierce + 2d8 cold = 23 (with res)

Pointless fear (do it at start, onions and garlic).
NOTE: 72 two one or TWO creatures (hiffee) on breath
USE BREATH OFTEN. IT'S ACTUALLY BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE RESIST.

(EXPECT TO BE SLOWED)
=> 1 less claw, 1 less leg action => -(2d8+8 +2d6+8 bonus), -2AC
=> DEX SAVE DISADV.

=> E(DMG) = 128 slowed melee, 196 unslowed melee
NB: More if breath hits more than one. Otherwise breath is roughtly equal.
Breath worse if they CON SAVE 22.
Breath on 3x is about the same as unslowed melee.

=> E_late(DMG) = 3*32 = 96

## DEUS EX: Sansuri
Smiling one. Take focus for a turn or two.


## ROUGH CALCULATION;
Party; can maybe do 500dmg in 2 rounds, but reliably 300
Rider combo; with dragon, expect 200 in two rounds (if we let umnos attack)
Umnos solo: 75 pr. 100 hasted.


Dragon can go down in 2/3 rounds. At which point 300dmg dealt.
Try to limit Umnos to 100 per round. TODO: maybe scale weapon to have some LG.

Party has: 300 HP. Can heal about 100 per round at the cost of not damaging.

Math;
Average; 250+300+300 dmg needed. (3 rounds)
Hard: 250+500+500 (5 rounds)

in 5 rounds;
- 2 rounds: rider combo has done 200 (then died)
- (none round: dragon drained and umnos raging (one extra if they are weak)
- 2-4 rounds: umnos has lost his temp hp (at least 3 on hard) 150-300dmg
- 2 rounds; umnos on last hp, raging 200dmg

1 round sacrifice on sansuri?
1 round sacrifice on hiffee? (breath on her early)

up to 700 dmg taken by party. They have 300 + can heal 133 each => 700
They need to do some lockdown and magic to do well. Mordai has control magic, they have crit potential.


## RECAP
Dragon summoned. Picked up Umnos. One breath dive on familiar + Mordai. Then tuning fork arrowed onto dragon via stormbow arrow. From there, massive lightning bolts and lightning arrows unloaded into Fryggt in the course of 3 rounds. Meanwhile GW was trying to fight Fracto at the top of the dragon, not very successfully, as the mounted combatant feat meant he just dodged out of the way and forced the hit on the dragon. All these things combined meant you basically did 500dmg in 3 rounds to Fryggt and it crashed.

Umnos slammed you away with a thunderwave arc, then used a whole round to drop Blackrazor into Fryggt to absorb 500 temp HP. GW went to slap the shit out of him as this was happening. Then he started to rage and casted haste on himself.
=> Res Bludgeoning, adv everything (blackrazor), +2 ac (haste)

Lots of work set out for you. While he was near the tuning fork for some time, he was originally immune to LG so it didn't help too much. Silence helped a bit, to limit the thunderwaves, but his lightning/necrotic blade with between 3-7 attacks per round (depending on how he split the leg actions) meant that there were lots of damage drained. GW alone took 330 damage. He only fell for a few seconds, after which Mordai (next in initiative order was quick to dump a healing potion in him). Then darkness buble on his face set in.

(suprised no one tried to slow/stun him)

Ten rounds in, haste potion expired, and one dangerous round later, the party was still in tact, though without Stagweaver (pegasus greater steed summon) and Hiffee (Valkyrie GW summon).
In the last round Mordai twinned a haste on Faey + GW and they pummelled the blind storm giant rules together.

Tree started growing again, sprouting roots. Voice from above telling GW to "at last. come. you've earned this."
