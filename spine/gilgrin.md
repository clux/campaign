# Gilgrin
Gilgrin map verbatim.

Huge amount of hobgoblins  / goliaths pushing a flywheel. Overseen by 6 fire giants + 4 on bridge + 2 bosses upstairs.
If they stop the wheel, giants hostile. Or reinforcements come.
Feeds much of the crystal energy. Stopping the wheel



## Fortress upwards
Toilet wall inside
Pass through assembly hall
Huge assembly hall. Hell hound

## Fortress top
Zoltan + Dreadnaught + Blue Crystal
Has the spells â€“ otherwise fire giant stats. + 2 hell hounds.
https://5e.tools/bestiary/duke-zalto-skt.html <- ish
https://old.reddit.com/r/UnearthedArcana/comments/f2ps43/molten_upheaval_wall_of_lava_new_molten_lava/ - wall of lava + molten upheaval spells!

Zoltan: Reports to Irae
Dreadnaught has the titan knuckles + two pairs of +2 shields.

Crystal is main power source (pre-powered). It powers the energy field upstairs.
Upstairs is a similar one that harnesses the energy, plus one that is dedicated (black) to maintaining demon lord portals.

Arcs: isolate them so they can be taken on similarly. Solo battle is going to be tough.
If they destroy it, they better fucking high-tail it. They might persuade him to check on the vault.


## Vault
### Inside
Using https://old.reddit.com/r/DnD/comments/aog16x/ocartthe_biggest_dungeon_multilayered_with_mixed/

Old dwarven mine. Taken over. Zoltan uses mind controlled duergar as slaves.

They arrive in through the middle. Straight across is Felgolos - doors locked. Need to barge in to top right door (brekable), fly up in middle, get into locked.

Final altar on the top left contains the Hammer. Unlooted. That's where the giants normally smite, but Umnos uses the dragons abilities
Seal off lower left.

Some of the best loot is in the side-rooms on the top right.

#### Bottom left: desecrated dwarf
Destroyed, almost pulverized parts of a dwarven corpse. Room sealed. Statue of Moradin. Skull intact (can let them locate Whelm).

Hammer of thunder lodged in the statue of Mordain.

LORE: Originally crafted here, but "cursed" in Gauntlgrym (via that one named evil dwarf - Grymin). Now shackled to a the center of a giant statue.
Door sealed. Sense magic emanating.
Hammer of Thunder (needs >20 str - can get Manual from felgolos / frostburn on markis, or king for fire belt, or luskan jax for a 21 belt)
Manual of Bodily Health

Sealed off at construction time as best they could to seal the most evil dwarven weapon off. However, smaller corridors still somewhat accessible (if willing to take lava damage).

##### Bottom left small rooms
iron ingots, supplies, mostly abandoned.
library, dusted over, used to be place of worship for Moradin.
books; one about Akkhan, large dwarf who served as a king 600 years ago and was a champion of Kavaki.

#### Top Left: Entrance hall
Main doors locked, requires like 25+ athletics to break down, but more feasible. Deadbolt on other side.

#### Top left small rooms
Felgolos sometimes wander these hallways, and he has repurposed a shrine to Bahamut (good metalic dragon good history 15, as opposed to tiamat worshipped by chromatic dragons). Taking it would not sit well with Felgolos if noticed (will not want to leave without it, and will try to cast locate object).

Leftover materials, large amounts of food summoned here for felgolos. Construct wanders the hall and guards it; Iron Golem CR16.

Room with red; smaller anvils. Used to do tweaks and smaller weaponry. Iron ore and steel ingots.

Books; about famous dragons in the world. Written 800 years ago.
Talks about Fryggt a young white dragon adopted at birth by giants as peace offering from the dwarves. Talks about Galadaeros a copper dragon of age 100 (who was sometimes in Waterdeep) who gave birth to at the time to Felgolos. Felgolos was watched over by the Arcane Brotherhood in Luskan and has since disappeared and not been seen since. Talks about a two ancient dragons past, a blue and green dragons who resided together, unusually, in the east. Had two babies, one killed, the other lost. Also mentions notable adult guardians at the time. An ancient blue dragon in Neverwinter.

#### Top Left: Dwarven Forge
Now used by giants. A statue sits resting on the floor. The altar is a Golem, Altar Flame (beefed up). Asks for password when users take weapons near door. Will bullrush down the corridorand breathe fire as he runs to one side.

In forges on left, 3 weapons, just lacking a few finishing touches to the hilt sit hardened and polished.

+3 Cleaver Greataxe 1d12 (lets you hit everyone in a 5ft reach in 30ft line - roll to hit against each - but this is an entire action including movement). Needs a 1000gp ruby + 5th level enchantment to activate.

+3 Two Handed Flail 2d6 (Golden Scourge - Divine Smite bounces 10 feet to up to 3 additional creatures) - an attempt to recreate Akkhan's weapon. Needs a 5th level radiant damage spell imbued plus the soul of Akkhan / 1000gp opal. Needs 21 strength.

+3 Greatsword 2d6 (Aegis Fang - Cast fireball on self on crit) - needs 21 STR - no attunement - needs 5th level evocation spell cast into it along with a 1000gp topaz.

(NB: must cast every day for a month unless upping spell level and gem level)
(NB: felgolos normally does this in exchange for visitation rights)

#### CENTER: Felgolos
[[felgolos]]

#### Lower Right: Library
Large spinning set of spheres, looks a mix between astronomical and magical. The three moons of toril spinning around, but you can tell they are creating some kind of force magic. Modified Mytholabe (force dmg over radiant, extra dice, force fields, not jabs). Must be destroyed to end forcefield. Old library in disarray. The labe has completely wrecked all books and the rest of this room.

If they do it, and were detected earlier, they have to fight Zoltan and his meat shield on the way out. But if they destroyed the crystal then Felgy can help.

#### Lower Right: Small rooms
In tact remnants of old dwarven parts. Akkhan had a room here. Hidden room in the back (behind what's not actually a pentagram). Within is a gemstone for Whelm. Moonstone 1000gp (extract aspects).

Moonstone can be used to talk to Kavaki. GW sees it light up in green (whisper). Like Cadeuces good, but with colors around illusions. Green very yes. Red, very no. Purple, mostly no, teal, mostly yes.

#### Top Right: Gravekeeper Guardians + Irae protection
Irae looted parts of Kiaransalee's relics here, and left the room cursed.
Statue to the Magnificent Matriarch (Quenthil Baenrae)
But as soon as they step past the middle or start looting corpses, touching doors/buttons she will trigger and turn into a bone golemn.
Undead fight in this room. Gravekeeper giant statue comes alive. 2-phase giant fight that summons undead. 200 HP giant. First 100HP, then she will fall to her knees, summon fires within and start the waves.


Summons 4 ogre zombies per round (from each row)
Top 4 chests looks heavily looted. But does have 2 scraps:

Bracers of Archery (coz whatever)
Cloak of Displacement (probably better in reliquary)
Iridium Galvanizer

### Top Right: Tombs
+3 Radiant Glaive 1d10 (boosts yourself STR modifier worth of temp hp - without misses against undead) - https://favpng.com/png_view/weapon-glaive-pole-weapon-guandao-blade-png/4qtN5R0i

Main tomb champion who stole from Shario.

Uroum Emberbeard
Wand of Fireballs


### Entrance
in the back
4 fire giants in the path. (Throw lava etc.)
Maybe Ring Servants CC318 as guardians within
