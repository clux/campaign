# Halos Labyrinth
Pass through spiral pathway upwards with Neri and her guards protecting.
Portal leads to [[halos-3]].

## Entrance
arthur-lee-04-elysion-scene02

## Map - Labyrinth Halos
Queen Neri taunts then by the entrance before fading away.
30 ft ceiling (just tall enough for giants)
She will attack from the shadows with lightning bolt bow.
If they stay still and scout as an action, then they will will be able to ready attacks. She will strike in certain areas. Blue areas for lightning arrow. Red areas for fire arrow. She can't reach the growths.

## Queen Neri
Slender storm giant. Smaller than the other. Still 14 feet.
"no one ventures beyond the veil unless accompanied by me and serissa"

Archer queen, splits her personality between 3 storm giant archers.
On hit, she switches. Each of the three archers revive in lair after 1 hour.
(Electrical fade animation - it looks like they're dying, but spirit drawn away - creating a trail of sparks through the wall).

All wearing large silver masks. They'll see who she is if she attacks. Her bow lights up the room with lightning. Misty steps as bonus actions. Rogue.

3 large gems there at the end. Lapus lazuli. Storm Giants reform there after they're dead. Once they are, she's defenseless (no one to port through, and rotate doesn't work as well - less and less successful per one down).
If they go straight for her, one of each of her acomplises join per round, and she'll poof between them.
If ONE dies. Lair action rotate happens.

Storm Bow: +2 Lightning Bolt Bow: Lightning Bolt on Crit CON 18 save vs 8d6
Once per day chain lighting launch attack: launch one arrows (as attack action), casting chain lightning on hit. Note that the while this cascading chain lightning can arc to up to 9 targets.

flying platforms, misty step (changes faces legendary 2 actions)

legendary action change faces
lair action swap people
lair action teleport people (translation polar coords)

### Lines
taunt: "so you've come after all, welcome"
"you have a lot to answer for"

"irae is not be happy about you"
"but i am happy to be the one that ends you"

taunt: "welcome to your tomb"

She'll stand behind one of the pillars in the open room.

Difficult terrain. It's her favoured terrain.

items; scroll of identify x2. scroll of lightning arrow.

### Surrender
She's angry with them. They invaded their lair. They killed white dragon pets.
They killed Neri, you burned her body.
Irae warned us about you, but no one thought you were going to be this... destructive.
She gave umnos an ancient black sword with incredible necrotic powers.

### Resurrection Pods
Blue gems.
She'll be at one of them, retreat if they come. Otherwise they have a chance to destroy the gem. Visible giant corspe shattering. Necrotic energies.
Either they all die, and she'll surrender, or she'll surrender if locked down (but will try to revive if possible).

### Stats
Neri is a storm giant quintesssent. But uses lightning bow; 2 attacks +14 to hit. 5d8 lightning + 1d8+10 piercing.
Alternatively; chain lighting bow action; recharde 5/6 on d6.
Otherwise same legendary actions as quintescent.
Can step into ethereal plane while 3 lapus lazuli crystals are in place.
Favoured terrain. Will try Banishment.

Hunters mark. Misty step. Passive lightning arrow at 4th level to justify dmg.
Normal rangers have 1d8+7 piercing + 4d8 lg (double attack).

Mechanics: she does chain lightning once per cycle. Each cycle is one giant enters per round. She will change faces if she's hit. If one giant helper dies, rotate happens.

Once she is alone; enrage? Tenser? Haste? (she has that..)

### Transition to Halos 3
Picture of portal water coming out of it as Faey approaches it (he is the key). https://youtu.be/QvFBvIjUlr4?t=512 for picture. It will take them to Faey's exit. Show top of Mithrendain: https://youtu.be/QvFBvIjUlr4?t=445 picture.

After Seelie Court. Message from below saying things happened, fryggt is gone? Come down. We have much to tell you. Message from Ailos. If you've dispatched the queens, then you control the lower end. The portal above is probably attuned to you.

felgolos had to head eastwards to save Baratathlaer (taken by Irae and gang)
He had to go, but he said as token of his appreciation he left this. Divine Scourge, and he taught Gludom how to prepare you a feast for heroes.

They can get Sansuri. She demands blood. Remind them of powers. Identify things.
Fryggt left post (when queens both ded). Cold res?
They've researched more into the potential of dragon eggs as amplifiers to open gates. If enacted, you need to deactivate or destroy all of them. Felgolos wanted them to deactivate one. Dispel/Greater Restoration.

Gate changes. Path up that turns icy.

(Pentachoron identified as a planar teleporter. Goblin came out of it earlier trying to move it. But he escaped into it. We think it contains a rather large plane, demi-plane, pocket-plane hard to tell.)

## Mask notability
Created by Umnos early on. They prevent magical divination like scrying from working on the wearer.

## Timeline Note Drow
Drow started attacking Gilgrin as they've gotten wind of the source of the summoning. However, this is not the main enclave, because they took Gracklstugh and was happy to see chaos reign (good for the drow in the long run - if they can survive).




## Ideas
Large walkway partially destroyed. Archers on either side?
Tree roots sprouting everywhere (indicative of yggdrasil above)
Tree has allowed Umnos to ascend - and you see the aspect of him?
Tree is atop the thumb of a hand: https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/839710293011198533/
Maybe they have to pass through the hall of ancients;
pass through water in https://www.pinterest.co.uk/pin/AZhpMsuya3CsjgOwxBT5p8zPvozCHuK-QWjgwjNXjS2-rUBbdCabV_8/

# Spire pathway
Glass sylinder with stormy weather outside. They can see Fryggt and Felgolos breathe on their way up. Lightning spine carries on. They can also see bits of the lightning in 13F (direcly underneath).

(to highlight they can't go around)

maybe 120deg/60deg of the cylinder is just open (glass cover), portal below that dumps them into the air

# EBA1: 11/16 Staircase leads to Waterfountain fight from BL2 wizard tower
Circular  outlook point. This is a trap. Storm of Vengeance. If triggered calls guards.

If NOT triggered, they might be able to sneak past the fountain (BL2 wizard pool fight).

# EBA2: Cave
Hidden path up through the Behir + Basilisks.


# Ignored
## Irae confrontation (she left)
"You know, I don't have to use my most powerful magic all the time you know"
Create undead: Summons 6 ghouls / 3 ghasts as a lair action during the battle
While in the middle of Globe of Invulnerability (conc)
