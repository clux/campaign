# Halos Omphalos

### Spire
Contains final crystal. Prismatic wall (30 foot sphere around it - repeat cast with the power of the spine at full power, disappears if umnos dies).
Broken tree in the center.
Grows enormous with growing with blue roots that hook into the stone and spire below, and link the variour platforms.

## Peak; Halos Omphalos

## Umnos
No larger than a regular giant.
Huge bulging blue muscles and black energy swirling inside of him. large golden cumberbud (belt).
Blue light emits from his jaw, eyes, and it crackles from his hair (huge, windswept, crazy, even eyebrows and beard follows this style). Very Zeusy.
Mad from Blackrazor. Let Irae control the spine.

## Lines
She told me there would sacrifices to come.
But I did not think you'd try to hunt down and kill my family to get to me.
Well, now you are here. Show me what you got.

Responses;
- a little late for that, the blade hungers
- some alliances are inevitable; i do not wish to spend a millenium ruling in silence. my name must be known, so i can be granted access to ysgard (points to tree). soon, they will have to listen.

(Ok with world burning, mind affecting)

### Motivation
Allied with Irae. Sword now in a perfect symbiotic relationship with him. Irae has infused the sword with properties akin to Blackrazor. Been around since the time of Kiaransalee, so he is infused with the powers of them.

If enemy backs off, he can parry shots with weapon when dodging.

### Stage 1

Haste as enrage; 3 attacks.



## Dropped
### Umnos mindcontrol
Feeblemind?.. can be ended by greater restoration..
Dominate Monster at 9th level lasts up to 8 hours... she is just better at it..
Umnos in non-dominated is a previous champion of Auril, but does not need her anymore, he is as close to his own godhood as is possible.
He is CG normally. Enjoys the worship of all the Giants as Annam's presence has subsided. Wants to be the next Kavaki.

Can Irae really dominate a demi-god? Yes.
Divine boon to party if they save him +1 STR up to 20.

ALTERNATIVELY; he's crucified and about to ascend to become a death knight giant - he'll fly around in spectral form while his body is hung (they need to cast something to cancel it)

lines when freed (deep husky voice):
- "disease"
- "free"
- "not enemies" (holding back attack)
- "spell...fading...loosing hold...of my mind"
- "yeees. (backwards drawl pulling in air) i am back. thank the heavens."
- "you "
