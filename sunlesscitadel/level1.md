### 9 Riddle
Although I only have one string,
when you pluck it I will sing.
As I arch my back and draw my breath,
hear me play the song of death.
(A bow)

seed by having many arrow traps

### 10 Statue room
Flavor text replace: "tall elves in plate armor / humanoids in cloaks"
Quasit; "master does not want to be found (less monster but more nasal)"

### 11 Tomb of Ekalis
Just treasure. Ornate ceremonial dagger (+1 dagger) - silver inlinings, curved.
Plus a book that says gives a short account of what kind of happened.

Pages describing rituals trying to communicate with and appease the dragon Asharaldon. Seemed successful. Several of the sorcerers were able to bind their magic to the dragon as a source. They used this power of magic to form bricks of earch, and rapidly construct it. Powerful days, glory days. They tried to race dragons as well to keep the power going.
They managed to seal away draconic entities in jars and vessels. Contain them with magic.
but then a page has black splotches on it - not like his usual careful inking style.
"something went wrong today - large creatures came up from the below and killed one of the dragon wyrmlings. i felt a shiver down my spine and my magic felt weakened.. is this a punishement? Did we fail him?"
last entry
"This pain lingers, and the castle is shaking. When will the judgement cease?"
"I've relinquished command to Belak in the case of my absence. I fear I would not be in much use in this state. I'm going to lock myself away for a while, in the hope that the influence of this... rot, can be sealed out."

Level up.

### 13/14 Empty Room
And a water cache. Some saphires in the jar.

### 15
Meepo knows they sealed away southern end. "Section mMade us all funny." referring to magic effect of room beyond locked.

### 17 HORRIBLE STENCH
super hungry rats

### 21 Yusdrayl Throne
Talk vaguely. This guy is like a cult leader.
Feigns knowledge. Meepo more helpful.

NB: One quirky looking shaman (inventor) replaces one elite.
