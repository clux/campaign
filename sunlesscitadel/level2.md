## 47 Laboratory
2 combat goblins, 6 goblins following druidic recipes
NATURE: ingredients that will weaken a person, ARCANA: some known to have mutating effects

## Asharaldon shrine
Play up Asharaldon - and maybe let them cleric their way to it with a Religion check. Grant them a blessing: charisma check bonus still.

HE GLOWS AND REVERBS WITH SUCCESSFUL ILLUMINATION
THEN HE PERSUADES THE PARTY TO CAST FIRE ON THE STATUE
BUBLAN DOES SO.

STATUE LIGHTS UP ON FIRE. EYES LIGHT UP.
RASPUTIN'S EYES LIGHT UP.

Session start: Ask him in a deep draconic voice:
- "Mortal. Your prayers will be answered. Asharaldon accepts your sacrifice."
- "Backwards breath inwards": Take 4 points of necrotic damage.
Everyone see Rasputins eyes narrow into a long slit, charracteristic of the reptilian eye.
Rasputin: You see the the world in shades of yellow and orange both of your eyes out of sync (seeing two layers superimposed - out of character: like a bad drunk effect).
Rasputin: as you try to regain focus, what are you looking at?
(Focus => cast fairy fire - twice per day)


## 51 Library
Book in draconic. About Asharaldon. Ancient Blue Dragon of ages past.
"Talks about human sacrifices kept Asharaldon happy and gave the mages the powers to build the citadel."
Humans stepped in front of draconic statues and were rewarded (if they served as priests of asharaldon), otherwise they were drained of their life energy (and served as sacrifices for the priests).

## Belak Study
Book with why Citadel got fucked:
"But after everything had been built and their need for aid ceased, their sacrifices stopped, and their union soured"

## Twilight Grove
THIS IS THE BLURB (SKIP EVERYTHING UP TO THE PEOPLE DESCRIPTION):

Moonlight shines through in select rays from the ceiling.
The whole area is growing like a jungle and the plants themselves emit a faint, but soft glow.
..defo strices you as strange and unnatural the way these plants sustain themselve in this subterranean grove.

One majestic tree stands in the center amidts three marble dragon heads.
Several broken basins of stone, lie broken around it.

Then describe the people (from original blurb), SKIP LAST SENTENCE:
The younger humans have pale white skin and emit soft blue light from their eyes.

## Gulthias Tree
Dragon mouths on each side of the tree (marble)
"Tree grew upon the central shrine to Asharaldon"
"..and it is still receptive to the powers of the past"
"as a test I have made this very grove grow beautifully in a few days with the energy from a few of my ..friends"

Bradford oathbreaker zombie , Sharwyn skeltal mage
..as they step through a ray of moonlight that shines through the grove to somewhere above, you see an illusion fade across their faces


## Motivation
corrupted druid. funnels dragon cult energy through tree.
"I am Belak, druid of the High Forest. This to my garden."
(USE DRAGON PRIEST NOT CULTISTS FROM HIS POV)
if asked about Sharwyn + Bradford - "their energies are bound to the gulthias tree, they have helped it grow ever so much; Behold my twilight grove."

this tree is the key to this place. feed it and we can restore this place to its former glory" -- "i just need a few more")

If we can feed it enough power.. we can reconnect with Asharaldon. We can raise the citadel up from below and restore it to its former glory.

..though he will need to sacrifice one of them to do so.

"i will need one of you to sacrifice a part of yourself to do so"
"you shall retain your life, in some fashion"

(refusal: if you think you can just march in here, kill a lot of my workers, and believe i'll just let you waltz on out of here, you are sorely mistaken)

"while i had hoped you would surrender peacefully to the rigtheous call of Asharaldon, i am perfectly happy to strike you down so that we can fulfil our quest without you"
"who are you to stand between Faerun and the power of Asharaldon?"
"surrender and submit peacefully, or perish!"

## Combat Tactics
Belak: Flaming Sphere to concentrate / Barksin to concentrate.
If no combat: Cure Wounds on Bradford.
If safe, no combat: Shillelagh bonus action for more hit bonus.
If combat: Thunderwave; 15ft cube DC12 CON save vs 2d8 thunder + push 10ft (Save: half, no push)

Bradford: Tanky paladin (barkskin concentration) AC18 on AC16 off

Uses Dreadful Aspect:

>  channel the darkest emotions and focus them into a burst of magical menace. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see you. On a failed save, the target is frightened of you for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it.

Sharowyn:
Mage armor -> 15 (cast)
- Magic Missle / Sleep / Ray of Frost
- Dagger
