THEY SLEPT. AVOIDED THE TWIGS.
SKELETON TEND GARDEN.
LEVEL UP AT 46

## 46 Old Shrine
something something dragon hook

## 45 Fire Snake Node Room
snake will heat up the axe and give it a +1 bonus for the next 8 hours

## 47 Laboratory
2 combat goblins, 6 goblins following druidic recipes
NATURE: ingredients that will weaken a person, ARCANA: some known to have mutating effects
Goblin talk: talk about draconic creatures have risen from the deep. Keeps place warm. Makes weapons sharp.


## Arboretum
Play up dragon cult origins. More fire snakes. Gems + fire harnessing rising up. Fighter gets a +1 boost to their weapon and it's infused with fire.

## Asharaldon shrine
Play up Asharaldon - and maybe let them cleric their way to it with a Religion check. Grant them a blessing: charisma check bonus still.

## 51 Library
Book in draconic. About Asharaldon. Ancient Blue Dragon of ages past.
"Talks about human sacrifices kept Asharaldon happy and gave the mages the powers to build the citadel."
Humans stepped in front of draconic statues and were either incinerated (if it was a sacrificial ritual), or they were rewarded (if they were priests of asharaldon and they were still serving him well).

## Belak Study
Book with why Citadel got fucked:
"But after everything had been built and their need for aid ceased, their sacrifices stopped, and their union soured"

## Twilight Grove
THIS IS THE BLURB:

Moonlight shines through in select rays from the ceiling.
Whole plays is growing like a jungle and the plants illuminate.
..there's defo something strange and unnatural about the way the plants grow.

One majestic tree stands in the center amidts three marble dragon heads.
Several broken basins of stone, lie broken around it.

Then describe the people, skip the tree parts in the original blurb. Eyes are not black eyed, blue light instead.

## Gulthias Tree
Dragon mouths on each side of the tree (marble)
"Tree grew upon the central shrine to Asharaldon"
"..and it is still receptive to the powers of the past"
"as a test I have made this very grove grow beautifully in a few days with the energy from a few of my ..friends"

Bradford oathbreaker zombie , Sharwyn skeltal mage
..as they step through a ray of moonlight that shines through the grove to somewhere above, you see an illusion fade across their faces


## Motivation
"I am Belak, druid of the High Forest".
(USE DRAGON PRIEST NOT CULTISTS FROM HIS POV)
(if asked about Sharwyn + Bradford - "their energies are bound to the shrine for now, they have helped start filling the shrine with their energy to see the place restored" - "i just need a few more")

If we can feed it enough power.. we can reconnect with Asharaldon. We can raise the citadel up from below and restore it to its former glory.

..though he will need to sacrifice one of them to do so.

"i will need one of you to sacrifice a part of yourself to do so"
"you shall retain your life, in some fashion"

"while i had hoped you would come peacefully, i am perfectly happy to strike you down so that we can fulfil our righteous call"
"who are you to stand between Faerun and the power of Asharaldon?"
"surrender and submit peacefully, or perish!"

## Combat Tactics
Bradford: Tanky paladin (barkskin concentration) AC18 on AC16 off

Uses Dreadful Aspect:

>  channel the darkest emotions and focus them into a burst of magical menace. Each creature of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw if it can see you. On a failed save, the target is frightened of you for 1 minute. If a creature frightened by this effect ends its turn more than 30 feet away from you, it can attempt another Wisdom saving throw to end the effect on it.

Sharowyn:
Mage armor -> 15 (cast)
- Magic Missle / Sleep / Ray of Frost
- Dagger
