Hamnal; on your pilgrimage westwards
on your journey you encountered a small gnome who took an interest in your quest.

Arrive by nightfall in the small village of Oakhurst.

### Old Boar Inn
Bard story:
"Once upon a time, there was a beautiful fortress, inhabited by many aspiring sorcerers. They worshipped the dragon Ashardalon. They thought themselves successful, and tried obtaining fortunes and favours from this draconic being. Where they successful? Well, they built one of the most grandiose fortresses of their time, at least one not confined within city walls to be used for corrupt rulers. But as we all know; a human is to a dragon, what a bug is to a human. They probably used goblins as slaves to build the damn fortress, and how far did it get them in the end? You've all seen the state of it. Sunken. Into the ground. A fortress for goblins below below the planet's crust. Destroyed by Ashardalon? Who knows. This is what you get when you dabble with powers you don't understand.

Live an honest life. If you know magic, good on ya, keep it simple. Abuse of power might protect you, but before you know it, you'll be underground."

(throws you a couple of copper pieces)
"Ahh, quit your moralising scald. You are way too young to be taking that tone. Have a drink." - Sannon Grag

In the corner, of the room, a human dressed in tight fitting black leather armor. Smiling as the story finishes. INTRODUCE CLEMENTINE.

Villagers. Will ask if they are here for the fruit sale? (Next week - tell the usual price range and goblin sellers. + Kerowyn's mission)


### Village Hall: Mayor Broumin Goldenfeet - scottish noble
slighly authoritarian posh voice. weak scottish blend.
ex-taylor + master armor crafter for nobles in Gauntlgrym 200y ago (back when the drow still influenced things)
ROOM:
- warm oakwood room - artificially lit from a quartz-like crystal standing on a table in the corner
- red wooden cabinets (with fine clothes for dwarves and humans)
- a 3ft wooden staircase elevates the southern end of the room
- and beyond this, perched atop the end, behind a dark wooden desk with papers, a half-smouldering pipe
- a dwarven noble, bald, with large white beard and military armor

"well, hello there. i'm brumin' - neeis to meet'ya"

knows history of sinking - supposedly 200y ago to vanquish a cult with a necromancer "suppose they all needed something to believe in"
"overly grandiose", "justifications for dark magic", "dabbled in necromancy"
"happens to everyone who grow too enamoured with power"
"if you're here to make a name for yourself, then you can help by clearing out the goblins in the citadel - and finding where they get their magic fruit from"
200gp reward each if they clear them out.
(justifying the murder by pointing at greenskins' constant harassment of small-scale villages - how many families' livestock do we want to see slaughtered just so the greenskins can multiply down below)

Tell them about cattle hearders rumor.
Tell them about kobold friend.
"You're not going to kill them are you?" "the greenskins and the reptiles?"
"They are only defending themselves." (trap warning)

### General Store - Kerowyn distressed matriarch
Kerowyn - seeds the rescue mission arc. 125gp reward per signet ring each.
Double if you can find them alive. (rings bear kerowyn sigils).
