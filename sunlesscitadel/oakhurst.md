Hamnal; on your pilgrimage westwards
on your journey you encountered a small gnome who took an interest in your quest.

Arrive by nightfall in the small village of Oakhurst.

### Old Boar Inn
Bard story:
"Once upon a time, there was a beautiful fortress, inhabited by many aspiring sorcerers. They worshipped the dragon Ashardalon. They thought themselves successful, and tried obtaining fortunes and favours from this draconic being. Where they successful? Well, they built one of the most grandiose fortresses of their time, at least one not confined within city walls to be used for corrupt rulers. But as we all know; a human is to a dragon, what a bug is to a human. They probably used goblins as slaves to build the damn fortress, and how far did it get them in the end? You've all seen the state of it. Sunken. Into the ground. A fortress for goblins below below the planet's crust. This is what you get when you dabble with magic you don't understand.

Live an honest life. If you know magic, good on ya, keep it simple. Abuse of power might protect you, but before you know it, you'll be underground."

(throws you a couple of copper pieces)
"Ahh, quit your moralising scald. You are way too young to be taking that tone." - Sannon Grag

In the corner, of the room, a human dressed in tight fitting black leather armor. Smiling as the story finishes.
