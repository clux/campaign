![](tappy.png)
> Knows about: ghosts (getting worse), a crazy svirf back in the day, stoneheart enclave ogremoch soln (untrue), wererat division, myconids dancing near whiteshell mine (talking about wedding)
- She has a crush on Dorbo, but is getting it on with Kazook (hidden).
- Voice: old spinster crossed with monster voice. Enthusiastic.

### Interactions
- She served them Basilisk, and tried to get it on with Hjarka and then Bron (both failed).
- They really disliked her enthusiasm, and they think she's quite old.


### Gara Songstone
Plays on crystals (like xylophone). She’s a bard. Plays for 8 children ine area 15 (wherever).

![](blingdenstone-children.png)

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZOM488Fv0
Mechanics: they can listen in (stealth) or talk to the children. If they listen in she likes you more. Talking to the children; they find Driete and Zedmunk talking to them. Might steal gold from Mordai (perception). Easily intimidated.

### Nomi Pathshutter
In stoneheart quarry.
Earth elemental wrangler. Guards elemental army while Yantha is in Manthol-Derith.
Deceptively friendly but smart and exploitative (knows of Ogremoch). Would be interested in Hjarka.

### Gliphic Shroomlight
novice priest at 7 - Stoneheart member
Nervous, sells potions and elixirs, antitoxin
“Thanks for helping out, these ooze incursions are becoming more frequent.”

### Jadger
- Burrow Warden in area 8
- Ghost Svirf. Trains others for Burrow Warden.
- Wants them to kill ghost in 12a + rockblight quest Udhask.
- Perished along with most in the drow invasion.
- Normal, but light ghost voice.

#### Quest: Cleanse ghosts
- Vazuk (grief stricken specter/poltergeist in 12a (shimmering turquise, half decayed)
- Udhask (remnant in rockblight - heart attack at invasion)

#### Ghost status:
> They killed the first ghost (Vazuk), found lots of rubies worth >1k GP. He told them he'd want them to clear the spirit of Udhak. They ignored him and fought elementals instead.

#### Trisk Adamantelpiece
(Traineer of Jadger)
Planning on revealing their existance to diggermattocks.
He basically doesn't exist unless they ask.

## Foaming Mug
Inn with food and 2x hot springs. No people. Super enthusiastic female gnome. Recently reopenend. Empty when they arrive first time. Zhurkwood kegs. Some used as tables.
Apparently it looks like the Gatwick pubs :-(

### Goldwhiskers
Spike is Chipgrin. A level 6 something.
Maybe he can just fuck off by pissing off people, then surprise, he's another dude.
#### Whisker Warrren
5 Wererats (CR2) => 2250XP (4500 Adjusted) But excluding ~CR8 Barb Chipgrin.

> Multiple scruffy looking deep gnomes look up at you suspiciously.  Many of them look armed, and armoured, while many cower in the background with women and children. The, what you think is 5 main tough looking gnomes part to let you through towards the far end of the cavern where you can see an elevation. On top of this elevation you see a really beefy looking creature, not wearing any armour, but pumped like he's not dropped arm day for years. Sitting on top of a stone chair flanked by two giant rats. Draped over the chair's back is a cave badger pelt.

> <--TODO: insert rough character description of how spike rolls chipgrin-->. As you approach, he looks towards you. <--Expecting Spike to suddenly introduce himself here-->.

#### Dorbo Negotiation
- Dorbo: Chipgrin. You’ve got some nerve coming here after infected too many of our good people.
- Chip: We’ve got no choice the way you keep us all quarantined off like we’re animals.
- Dorbo: you are animals, look at you. You’ve got hair on your nose.
- Dorbo: ASK ADVENTURER, did he put you up to this?
- Dorbo: You think you can fit into our society like this? You are abominations.
- Chip: What do you want us to do, keep hiding away in these cursed caverns while we could help out?
- Dorbo: You couldn’t help if you tried. You’d just convert all our children. You’re better off gone.
- Chip: We can get in an out as we want. We’re not disturbing you any more than we have to.
- Dorbo: So why are you even here?
- Chip: I thought maybe we could broker a truce, but I can see I was mistaken.
- Dorbo: Maybe you should leave while you have the chance. Before we send our newfound forces at you.
- Dorbo: ASK ADVENTURERS, you’ve all promoted to Blingdenston Pest Control. What do you say.
- Chip: So this is how it is huh. I guess you can all rot with the oozes.
- Chip: TELL ADVENTURES: should’ve known you’re not to be trusted (AND AFTER DOING X WITH YOU)
- Chip: I know how to get to the pudding king.
- Dorbo: Adventurers, what do you proposes we do?

If they are clever they can get it back on track by talking about oozes.
Maybe they’ll backstab one party and get the intel, or maybe they can broker an uneasy truce.

Give them potions to attack if all goes well.
In neg room: 6gnomes + 1 galeb duhr

#### Pool of Zhooblex
Read first paragraph. bit on p112 first

> In the pool you see multiple of them rise up from their spherical pit and coalesce into a large black and green shape that almost takes on a life of its own. One of the oozes wrap around the creature to give it a tight shape as it packs around it, forming these deep green striations. The chaotic creation is flailing around, its lower parts bound by the pit and its limbs form look primitive

#### Pudding King
Carried by shaped oozes on a throne eating pudding.
Hedonism Bot.
Watching ooze display in pool.

> At the back you a slimy looking deep gnome sitting on top a suspicious looking lifted throne or couch. Upon closer look the whole throne is alive and made out at least two intersecting oozes. One black, and one pink, wrapping around each other like candy, as these four 10ft long and quick thick living legs sway gently from side to side, holding together strangely like some type of non-Newtonian fluid.

#### Pudding Lines
- Bravo! Bravo! It's coming together beautifully!
- Ebonmire! Prepare the icing. We most look our most glistening for our lord.
- Euuh. Euuh mai, yes.

Describe smothering of pink goo atop his body.

-What's this? What's this? P112 second paragraph. "Begone!"

#### Mount
Spider mounts from Goldwhiskers
https://www.reddit.com/r/DnDBehindTheScreen/comments/9j3kmt/quit_horsing_around_5_dd_5e_vermin_mounts_steal/

#### Celebration
- Shots made out of Ochre Jelly
- Some really fucking salty and gelatinous meat

#### Kazook Protege
Plenty of fire components for selling out a little to [[kazook]]. He will sell vital ingredients at a discount if he'll swear to only use his mending kit. Gunpowder in his lab.
His lab is well lit, but you can see the the black marks from an explosion emanating from the door in hovel. Door is unhinged and not swinging correctly.
Alchemical ingredients all over the place. Parts open above into another cavern opening. Blown open presumably.
Large creation, unfinished. Drill like top. Barrels of gunpowder at the ready.

#### Dorbo Rumors
Routes: Two routes, one unfortunately blown out by Kazook's experiments... He's working on a way to sort it.

Second known route is through a passage in Gracklstugh. The Duergar control this.
Occasionally surfacers in Mantol-Derith.
Gracklstugh may not be the most welcoming to outsiders. They maintain a truce with us out of necessity.
What can dorbo give them?

#### Dorbo Whisker Gratitude
With your help we can summon enough elementals to wipe out the oozes.

Knows they don't want to kill the rats:

You know, I've had a change of heart towards these wererats. They fought bravely for us today, when they had little reason to. I had Tappy prepare a few kegs of ale and food as thanks for their contribution. Would you mind taking a couple of healers kits, and these two kegs of celebratory ale to them, as thanks for their hard work.

Ale is poisonous. Ask if a couple of you want to bring that.

If they do, then the next morning, you see numerous gnomes exiting from that area, smoke coming from the waren.

Dorbo will admit it if pressed afterwards.

#### Kazook Rumors
- **Desperate lines**: Actually learned a lot from a friend. A friend who had access to some great secrets. Secrets he was not meant to have.
- **Drunk lines**: Ooh, you have seen Solas. He had this book right. All sorts of constructions in it. The things you could do with that. Oh well, I guess I'll have to do with being a middle grade tinkerer. You too I guess.. Someday.
- **Drunk Reconciliation**: look, I realise I've come off a little condescending. I recognise that you have some skills. Great potential in you perhaps. As a token of friendship, I've decided to give you this one time offer.. To be my protégé. I'll give you this magical mending glue, I've made. For you know, if your construction ever breaks down. …. also, you can use my lab for free in this trial period.
- **Drunk demand**: Oh, yes, but I do have one ask. My friend Solas. I have not heard from in in a while. If I am to keep teaching you, it's imperative that you seek him out.
- Also, by the way, if you find a couple of large gears and a blue cylinder please, bring them back. It'll allow me find a way out.

#### EBA
If they don't go to anywhere or just lounge towards gracklstugh...
