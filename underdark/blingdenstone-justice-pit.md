# Pit of Justice
![](blingdenstone-pit.png)
Glowing gemstone type symbol. They have a huge quartz gem cut out and there’s some light source behind it. Two badgers statues stand tall around next to the gem. (Segojan Earthcaller religion/history - earth nature death).

Two 20ft quartz crystals in the middle (replaces the center pillars in pic), remains of blood on the left crystal. Mostly evened out.

A thin, and uneven metal bar connects the top of these crystals (replaces door like thing in pic), from them, two red banners with Badgers painted on them are draped from the bar. All the way to the floor.

Large pieces of red cloth is draped from the ceilin

Actually, a dug out spider cave. At the top of the cave there's still tons of abandoned looking spider webs.

### Pit Plot
Have them learn better hand to hand combat. (To upgrade to 1 to D4 dmg)
Contact points from monk memory => limited d4 sneak attacks for rogue?
If they can beat [[travok]] 1v1 and 3v3, [[gurnik]] will bless your weapon of choice.

### Pit Mechanics
D4 dmg rather than 1 for unarmed strike
D4 dice for smite (same number of dice) - normally D8 dice
D4 dice for sneak attack (same number of dice) , but –1 per dice (normally D6)

Fight start -> Place yer bets!
Betting: 50-50 in 1v1, small comission.

- Cleric is a 9th level cleric. Can cast Death Ward
- **Travok**(5): w/rage: d4 + STR4 + 2(rage) for 3x attacks (bonus frenzy) => 28pr
- 15AC, 55hp. Also has resistance.. So effectively 110.
- Main stats: +7 to hit, adv on STR checks/saves
- Frenzy after stun - he'll de-frenzy.
- Exhaustion: (1) lose adv on STR, disadv. On other saves. (2) speed halved. (3) disadv attack...
- **Travok**(4): w/rage: d4 + STR4 + 2(rage) for 2x attacks (bonus frenzy) 18pr
- -7 HP => effectively 96HP
- **Goatweaver**: d4 + STR3  for 2x attacks => 12pr (but + ~12 for 2 x lvl2 limited smites) AC11, 44hp + lay on hands (25) (Can also give himself advantage with Channel Div, or potentially Fear him. One use!)
- **Windsorrow**: d6 + DEX4 for 2 or 4 attacks => 16->32pr (but stunning strike) AC16, 33hp, 5ki points
- **Pendle**: d4 + STR-1 for 2x attacks => 4pr (but 9 per sneak attack) AC13, 35hp
- **Hjarka**: d4 + STR3 for 2x attacks => 12pr (but ripose & trip chance) AC12, 54hp + second wind (d10+5)
- **Bron**: d4+ STR1 for 2x attacks => 2pr (but d8 colossus bonus) NEVER SEEN HIM USE, AC13, 51hp

I.e. need to bump unarmed from 1 to d4 to allow pendle to deal.
It would be a much quicker fight against hjarka and goatweaver though..

### Viable Fight options:
- 1v1 Hjarka vs Goatweaver (fisticuffs)
- 1v1 Goatweaver vs Windsorrow (fisticuffs)
- 2v2 GW+Bron vs Hjarka+Pendle
- 3v2 GW+WS+P vs Travok+Wolf(<=18HP) (combined HP 130 – first rounds are hard sentitnel + wlf dmg – vs - ~105HP with less avg AC, but higher dmg and stuns)
- 4vMOBS: 2 ghosts (warden) / 2x chuuls (challenge)

NOT VIABLE: 1vTravok (he’s too tanky and has too much dmg)
Maybe viable: 2vTravok: he’s tanky enough, but one trip and they’re good
Tweaked1: 2vsTravok+Wolf: he doesn’t rage until it’s dead, but can sentinel vs wolf.
=> they can get in some damage before he activates resistance.
Tweaked2: 1vsUmman: he doesn’t frenzy rage => 2x attack only, level him down to 4
