## Developments
- [[13-rockblight]]: Neheedra dead. Area 21 and 22 merged. They killed 3 rows of animated drow and activated Ogremoch.
- [[14-pit-of-justice]] : Fought in pit. GW got a +1 Maul. Menhir temple cleansed by 3p party. Only a single EE. Modified its attack styles.
## Menhir  Temple
One Earth Elemental per twist. Is this not boring? Variations?
1. One that stomps and is much taller and slower. DC12 DEX 3d8+5 DMG. 50HP 15AC
2. One that slams (traditional)
3. One that throws rocks, two throws. Same damage.

## Neheedra's Lair
Crystals. Slithering. Suddenly see a face passing by in the crystals, contorting as it slowly moves past. 4 snakes join in if too easy. Crystals. Make them do at least 2 saves early on, legendary action to meet her gaze if she has to. Maybe snake hair attack can cause the gaze. Maybe she just summons creatures and escapes.

### Neheedra Duskryn (rockblight)
Drow priestess turned medusa. Working with Ogremoch’s bane now.

Petrification: removable with basilisk blood.
Drow soldiers exhaustion: ogremoch’s bane (insta turn on elementals, madness for all, disadv to Hjarka)

She has Fey Ancestry.

#### Rewards
- Gloves of missle snaring on medusa. Mysterious Crown.
- Something eventually to give monk magic fist dmg.
- Periapt of Wound Closure rather than Blessing.
- Bow of hookshot (to hook onto place)
- Gems! Cast light? Tiny Servant?
- Glowpowder
- 5 metal arrows with an expansion anchor front.

Knowledge: books that speak of creatures in the underdark (illithids (enslaving kua toa)), (illithid tricked dwarves to dig to their enslavement - limited psyonic abilities), derro (small monstrous humanoids, probably created by drow, living nomadic lives). Random books! Svirfneblin didn’t bother to record history.

### Leading Cavern With Ogremoch
6x3 Animated armors stand in 3 rows across the crystal covered cavern.
If they defeat them, they can’t be summoned during Neheedra fight. If they don’t they don’t get the Feat.

**Hjarka** motivation / description. Statues of drow. Several are standing in a military pose with blank expressions, large chunks of the statues appear to be missing. Large indentations into one of the shoulder in a semi circular serated pattern has dug out a good chunk of this statue’s shoulder. You Hjarka sense something familiar in these statues. Even from their blank stares you get a sense of oppression.

If they don’t fight them they’ll funnel in on them later after Neheedra.

### Pretrification
Petrification: removable with basilisk blood + priest if persuasive.
Drow soldiers exhaustion: ogremoch’s bane (insta turn on elementals, madness for all, disadv to Hjarka)

## Pit of Justice
![](blingdenstone-pit.png)
Glowing gemstone type symbol. They have a huge quartz gem cut out and there’s some light source behind it. Two badgers statues stand tall around next to the gem. (Segojan Earthcaller religion/history - earth nature death).

Two 20ft quartz crystals in the middle (replaces the center pillars in pic), remains of blood on the left crystal. Mostly evened out.

A thin, and uneven metal bar connects the top of these crystals (replaces door like thing in pic), from them, two red banners with Badgers painted on them are draped from the bar. All the way to the floor.

Large pieces of red cloth is draped from the ceilin

Actually, a dug out spider cave. At the top of the cave there's still tons of abandoned looking spider webs.

### Pit Plot
Have them learn better hand to hand combat. (To upgrade to 1 to D4 dmg)
Contact points from monk memory => limited d4 sneak attacks for rogue?
If they can beat Travok 1v1 and 3v3, Gurnik will bless your weapon of choice.

### Pit Mechanics
D4 dmg rather than 1 for unarmed strike
D4 dice for smite (same number of dice) - normally D8 dice
D4 dice for sneak attack (same number of dice) , but –1 per dice (normally D6)

Fight start -> Place yer bets!
Betting: 50-50 in 1v1, small comission.

- Cleric is a 9th level cleric. Can cast Death Ward
- **Travok**(5): w/rage: d4 + STR4 + 2(rage) for 3x attacks (bonus frenzy) => 28pr
- 15AC, 55hp. Also has resistance.. So effectively 110.
- Main stats: +7 to hit, adv on STR checks/saves
- Frenzy after stun - he'll de-frenzy.
- Exhaustion: (1) lose adv on STR, disadv. On other saves. (2) speed halved. (3) disadv attack...
- **Travok**(4): w/rage: d4 + STR4 + 2(rage) for 2x attacks (bonus frenzy) 18pr
- -7 HP => effectively 96HP
- **Goatweaver**: d4 + STR3  for 2x attacks => 12pr (but + ~12 for 2 x lvl2 limited smites) AC11, 44hp + lay on hands (25) (Can also give himself advantage with Channel Div, or potentially Fear him. One use!)
- **Windsorrow**: d6 + DEX4 for 2 or 4 attacks => 16->32pr (but stunning strike) AC16, 33hp, 5ki points
- **Pendle**: d4 + STR-1 for 2x attacks => 4pr (but 9 per sneak attack) AC13, 35hp
- **Hjarka**: d4 + STR3 for 2x attacks => 12pr (but ripose & trip chance) AC12, 54hp + second wind (d10+5)
- **Bron**: d4+ STR1 for 2x attacks => 2pr (but d8 colossus bonus) NEVER SEEN HIM USE, AC13, 51hp

I.e. need to bump unarmed from 1 to d4 to allow pendle to deal.
It would be a much quicker fight against hjarka and goatweaver though..

### Viable Fight options:
- 1v1 Hjarka vs Goatweaver (fisticuffs)
- 1v1 Goatweaver vs Windsorrow (fisticuffs)
- 2v2 GW+Bron vs Hjarka+Pendle
- 3v2 GW+WS+P vs Travok+Wolf(<=18HP) (combined HP 130 – first rounds are hard sentitnel + wlf dmg – vs - ~105HP with less avg AC, but higher dmg and stuns)
- 4vMOBS: 2 ghosts (warden) / 2x chuuls (challenge)

NOT VIABLE: 1vTravok (he’s too tanky and has too much dmg)
Maybe viable: 2vTravok: he’s tanky enough, but one trip and they’re good
Tweaked1: 2vsTravok+Wolf: he doesn’t rage until it’s dead, but can sentinel vs wolf.
=> they can get in some damage before he activates resistance.
Tweaked2: 1vsUmman: he doesn’t frenzy rage => 2x attack only, level him down to 4

## EBAs
### Basilisk Area
For `Entemoch’s Boon`, they are controlled by a Drider?
Or maybe grell. Put some electricity in there.
Or a fun room. 20 weasels/badgers (food for the Basilisks)
Entrance? The two lone wanderers. The Elemental Vagabonds  (dust mephit + earth elemental) wandering can point them towards place.
