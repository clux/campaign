# Rockblight
## Menhir  Temple
One Earth Elemental per twist. Is this not boring? Variations?
1. One that stomps and is much taller and slower. DC12 DEX 3d8+5 DMG. 50HP 15AC
2. One that slams (traditional)
3. One that throws rocks, two throws. Same damage.

### Speaking stones
Circle of stone menhirs predating blingdenstone. Henge of ancient galeb duhr? p106

## Neheedra's Lair
Crystals. Slithering. Suddenly see a face passing by in the crystals, contorting as it slowly moves past. 4 snakes join in if too easy. Crystals. Make them do at least 2 saves early on, legendary action to meet her gaze if she has to. Maybe snake hair attack can cause the gaze. Maybe she just summons creatures and escapes.

### Neheedra Duskryn (rockblight)
Drow priestess turned medusa. Working with Ogremoch’s bane now.

Petrification: removable with basilisk blood.
Drow soldiers exhaustion: ogremoch’s bane (insta turn on elementals, madness for all, disadv to Hjarka)

She has Fey Ancestry.

#### Rewards
- Gloves of missle snaring on medusa. Mysterious Crown.
- Something eventually to give monk magic fist dmg.
- Periapt of Wound Closure rather than Blessing.
- Bow of hookshot (to hook onto place)
- Gems! Cast light? Tiny Servant?
- Glowpowder
- 5 metal arrows with an expansion anchor front.

Knowledge: books that speak of creatures in the underdark (illithids (enslaving kua toa)), (illithid tricked dwarves to dig to their enslavement - limited psyonic abilities), derro (small monstrous humanoids, probably created by drow, living nomadic lives). Random books! Svirfneblin didn’t bother to record history.

### Leading Cavern With Ogremoch
6x3 Animated armors stand in 3 rows across the crystal covered cavern.
If they defeat them, they can’t be summoned during Neheedra fight. If they don’t they don’t get the Feat.

**Hjarka** motivation / description. Statues of drow. Several are standing in a military pose with blank expressions, large chunks of the statues appear to be missing. Large indentations into one of the shoulder in a semi circular serated pattern has dug out a good chunk of this statue’s shoulder. You Hjarka sense something familiar in these statues. Even from their blank stares you get a sense of oppression.

If they don’t fight them they’ll funnel in on them later after Neheedra.

### Pretrification
Petrification: removable with basilisk blood + priest if persuasive.
Drow soldiers exhaustion: ogremoch’s bane (insta turn on elementals, madness for all, disadv to Hjarka)

## NB: Merge
21-22; Advice to Other DMs - Merge the Two Encounters

> With the benefit of hindsight, I should have merged the Drow Statues + Ogremoch's Bane encounter with the Steadfast Stone encounter. I would have surrounded the steadfast stone with thirty statues. When they were defeated, then ogremoch's bane would manifest. Everyone within the maelstrom should make a DC 12 Constitution save or take 1d4 damage each round. PCs would have to place the spell stone in the menhir and fend off all of the earth elementals in order to reconsecrate the stone, banishing Ogremoch's Bane upon successful reconsecration.

## EBAs
### Basilisk Area
For `Entemoch’s Boon`, they are controlled by a Drider?
Or maybe grell. Put some electricity in there.
Or a fun room. 20 weasels/badgers (food for the Basilisks)
Entrance? The two lone wanderers. The Elemental Vagabonds  (dust mephit + earth elemental) wandering can point them towards place.
