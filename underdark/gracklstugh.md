# Gracklstugh
Originally; Population: 6k (rather than original 10k+2kderro)
Now, 3k drow from [[menzo]] and 2k slaves.


## Old notes
- Abusive Guards still present
- Drow emissary tweakable
- Derro mostly dead
- Mad duergar useable in a dungeon?
- Orc mercenaries useable. Maybe hired to help repeal gnolls when they're done scavenging.

Deep King has allowed Gnolls to overrun poorer areas of the city. To weed out the weak.
Might not have gone fully after plan.

NPCs: Blue Shadow guild is there. With plenty of functional items for sale.
Grey ghosts is a thieves guild that stole eggs. TODO: Reconcile..

Council of Lairds. Sure, Deep King needs someone to control.
Military. Much smaller than in book:

100 veterans
Psonics agents (darkshafts – repurpose as Blue Shadow people?)

Kavalrachni – giant tarantula riders.
Xarrorn – deadly flame lancers.

Keepers of the flame: psionic clerics (duergar psionics?)  that deal with Thember. Vendetta vs. gray ghosts.

Themberchaud isn't walking about but sleeping in his Lair and is fat and lazy. Fire for Food. Heat and fire is funnelled into pipes that are used for all the forges in the city.

Quest from Thember? Wants to figure out what's what.
