# Telnarquel

Illithid colony in lowerdark. Unlabelled map found on corpse of [[ilvara]].
Secret colony. Explorers refused to believe it actually existed. Can be found by crashing supporting stalag causes floodwave that propels them into underground tunnel.

If they don't know where it is, they can go by WindSorrow's monastery to question master for clues. They can also find an Alhoon with Umber hulk friends outskirts.


## Motivation
Illithids are secretive, but they see store vast knowledge from ages past. Much can be learned from the elder brain if they can make it talk.
Giants true involvement? Irae? Kiaransalee?

Illithids don't pray on species that can kill them easily.
Dueragar + Svirf will know paths down, but hesitant to go themselves.
Careless to expand. Small colony. 80 flayers. Stay hidden. Maintain knowledge.
Ultimately want to hide from the Gith for now. Wait for bigger colony to succeed. Ulitharid sending out new expedition.
Limited by feeding. Need one brain per illithid per month: 12*80=< 1k brains a year. Detectable, but prays on weak races.

## EBA: Werewhisker tie-in
Demon Lord Chittrk'k'k - CC 76 – CR13
Along with converted wererats?

## EBA: Aboleth
See ToA version? But not silly. Disguises as trapped creature. Lures them in.
How can they realize? Many large bones – dragon size (not broken, but frail (old)).
Covered in mucous.
Will invite them over telepathically. Once they are close enough. 2 will be enslaved (to scare them into doing it). Then dropped once they agree to do what it wants.
Wants the Ulitharid brought to him alive.
Otherwise his enslaved pet dragon will block the way back.
