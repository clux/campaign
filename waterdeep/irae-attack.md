# Waterdeep Siege
Battleplan for Irae, Kua-Toans + Demogorgon assaulting Waterdeep.

## Pre-battle Prep
Mages will slowly uncover lore about Shario (Diano knows basic, Ursula can research as she believes it). Slowly uncover bits and bobs every day. Learn about the final battle just before.

They can visit the tomb of Shario below Castle Waterdeep (middle of mountain, sealed). Winding tunnel. Several seals, and several magical keys. First have to spend two hours magically excavating the tunnel. At the bottom, a single room with 2x Deva's + Planetar (to make sure it's not lied to) returning as soon at they touch. If their intentions are good they can POSSIBLY see the body. But need super persuasive powers to take the amulet.


## General Plan
Demogorgon + 50 Kua-Toans coming up from the sewer grates.
Shooshar running up before everything? Rides a giant turtle from darklake.
One Kua-Toan will ask for the blade of shadows, or the Prince of Shadows will come to retrieve it himself.

Attack will happen at mid day, but dark mist covers the air (~mirage arcana), blocks out the sun.

Mages will defend the city against Demogorgon. Delayed blast fireball. Demo will pick it up if it's too soon. Ursula: "Don't look it in the eyes."
Demogorgon will smash the mages tower (massive bludgeoning to everyone inside) so the safe with the blade gets to ground level.

While the battle rages, Irae will swoop in to grab it. NB: Don't do this at all costs. If they escape with it, she'll definitely stalk them at night.

If they leave the mages by themselves, they are likely to die alone.
But they might be able to run away with the blade.

Level them if they defeat the Prince of Daemons.
Demogorgon leaves once Irae is satisfied.

Irae's been scrying on the party successfully. If they try to escape with the artifact, she will follow them.


## Irae tactics
### Time Stop (PLOT - 40s)
Just before: As the battle rages on and the darkness now covering the entire sky, it feels like you are in the midst of an eclipse, while all the spells light up the city from below. The mist, however, swirls like a tornado above you.

As the mists swirls intensify, you start noticing a shape in the midst of this now very circular eye of the storm. Big black arcane runes etched into the sky.

Everything goes gray. Not in the sense of you losing control, but in the sense that there is only darkness. You do not see nor hear anything. You do not exist. Except for you Mordai. You see the world. Grey, black mist swirling all around you at a different rate. Your body, restrained by an inherent slowness. You slowly look around, all your party members, Goatweaver, Faey, mages, all frozen in time. Yet to the side, Hanir, floats in the air, mid jump, glitchily flickering in and out of existence. As you slowly turn your head up towards the darkness, an elven figure floating into view, casting dim blue light from the luminescent smoke trailing her figure. As her strong jawline and flesh reaches a certain point of proximity, the illusion is broken; you see reveals hollow bone covering her face.

(When she sees Mordai not affected). How interesting. You understand the flow of time yourself.
*Casts higher level locate object (divination 3)* (does not proc timestop end)

Why/what?
Fulfilling a prophecy, of course. You of all people should know this. Creatures do not exist in this timeline unless they have been tampering with it.
Arklem? Hah, always quick to acquiesce when tempted.


"And what are you going to do? You are too late. By the time the baboon's face stares down the soul of your desparate champions, I will be long gone."
(didn't say this because i proc'd timestop as demogorgon died)

Once she takes the bag, it procs timestop. She will then use movement to fly 50ft away. Cast spells as legendary action/reaction.

Casting chronomancy within timestop will summon Dahaka.

Don't be a dick: throw in a Feeblemind/Fear against party or a tentacle against champions if they are in serious trouble (near death or too charmed)
Felgolos will arrive near the end (deus ex machina). DC21 DEX SAVE VS FIRE.
Champions can tank some tentacles?

Ask them to stay close before fireball hits, we can haste after.
Diana:

- Mordenkainen's Private Sanctum for mages in desperation (unwise to escapewith shadow blade in there)

- Feeblemind (desperate attempt.. but can be really powerful)
- Sunburst (con save vs radiant dmg)
- Counterspell (battle roll vs Irae) - PROBABLY DONT DO THIS...
Ursula:
- staff of healing: mass cure wounds

- Beacon of Hope / Dispel / Lesser Restoration / Sanctuary / Protection from Evil and Good
- Protection Reaction: impose disadv on attack roll when you see a target attack other than you <=5ft


## After battle
Research into burial grounds?
Try to scry on her? (hard: vs mindblank)
Read about the Acropolis.
"If history can teach us something here, it's necromancers can work together, if united under the banner of a deity allowed to ascend. Divinity carries a plethora of stories like these; Bhaal (lord of murder), Myrkul (lord of bones), Bane (lord of darkness), and, it would seem; Kiaransalee (the revenancer).
"if one is close to obtaining the power of a god..."

learn of V'elddrinnsshar a city to the east cituated in a mile wide island in the centre of the Moondeep Sea (below Galena Mountains to the east).

note that if they are to keep facing daemon lords, they ought to learn about their weaknesses. "according to our analysis, the attack of demogorgon would have been successful if it were not from a single source of radiant damage."
Now, we do not mean to diminish the endeavors of anyone in this battle, but praise is required here; "Goatweaver; we owe you so much."
Honorary Arch-Mage title offered.


## Recap Demogorgon battle
Defended the city of Waterdeep from an attack against the prince of daemons.
A battle that raged on for 7 rounds, with a hasted, beaconed, holy weaponed paladin unloading all the radiant energy at their disposal, the battle was swinging back and forth heavily as black mist started swirling above the battle field.

The mages helped out a little bit, but unfortunately most of their protective magic and healing was useless against demogorgon's health max draining attacks.

Hans was charmed, cast cone of cold on Mordai.
Faey was charmed, punched GW to the ground and critted against him on the ground.

The sky started crackling with arcane energy as the swirl turned into an eye of a storm, and large black arcane runes became visible.

Goatweaver came back up from a cure wounds delivered via Mordai's familiar and he dealt another 102 damage before misty stepping away leaving demogorgon mortally wounded.

Still, this was not enough to take him down, so next time around, the prince followed and killed GW (reduced to 0 max hp), and carried on hitting Faey (also very low).

Mordai from the skies delivered the final blow via his familiar and inflict wounds. However, just as this hit, time stopped. Irae swooped down to see everyone frozen, except Mordai, strangely, who seemed to be somewhat resistent to the effects of the time-altering magic.

On a path to "fulfilling a prophecy", she cut the band around the bag of holding, ending the time stop, and she started flying away with it.

This now caused a race between the wizard Lotte, starting a resurrection ritual below after having gotten Hans and Faey, and Mordai ushering Faey to rather focus on Irae.

In the end, Irae got away with a teleport, but not without suffering heavy damage (her defenses did not look super impressive). Goatweaver, otoh, laid there, half-ignored from the resurrection ritual.

TODO: leave this more ambiguous if GW wants to be in on it...
Goatweaver, you are here today, because Hans shook your happy soul to the core; reminding you of the purpose you still have left unfilfilled.
Less than an hour ago; you were unloading radiant energy on a divine scale into the prince of demons. You see his corpse right there on the ground, you should feel like a hero. But looking at your party, something is amiss. You look at your Hans, having just helped you up, while giving you a friendly smile and a hug, you feel his green aura extends from his body and warm your spirit. Looking around to the rest of the party; that familiar warmth is feeling a little colder today.

You look over to your trustworthy elf, and see the master manipulator you've come to appreciate on the battlefield. Capable of locking down almost any enemy, and deflecting damage away from the party. But do you really know what he's after? His aura is confusing.

Then there's the thiefling. Clearly very smart, always on the hunt for knowledge and as far as you can tell, in it for some definition of the greater good. But does that definition of the greater good, include you?
