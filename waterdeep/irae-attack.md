# Waterdeep Siege
Battleplan for Irae, Kua-Toans + Demogorgon assaulting Waterdeep.

## Pre-battle Prep
Mages will slowly uncover lore about Shario (Diano knows basic, Ursula can research as she believes it). Slowly uncover bits and bobs every day. Learn about the final battle just before.

They can visit the tomb of Shario below Castle Waterdeep (middle of mountain, sealed). Winding tunnel. Several seals, and several magical keys. First have to spend two hours magically excavating the tunnel. At the bottom, a single room with 2x Deva's + Planetar (to make sure it's not lied to) returning as soon at they touch. If their intentions are good they can POSSIBLY see the body. But need super persuasive powers to take the amulet.


## General Plan
Demogorgon + 50 Kua-Toans coming up from the sewer grates.
Shooshar running up before everything? Rides a giant turtle from darklake.
One Kua-Toan will ask for the blade of shadows, or the Prince of Shadows will come to retrieve it himself.

Attack will happen at midnight, during a full moon. Dark mist covers the air.

Mages will defend the city against Demogorgon. Delayed blast fireball. Demo will pick it up if it's too soon. Ursula: "Don't look it in the eyes."
Demogorgon will smash the mages tower (massive bludgeoning to everyone inside) so the safe with the blade gets to ground level.

While the battle rages, Irae will swoop in to grab it. NB: Don't do this at all costs. If they escape with it, she'll definitely stalk them at night.

If they leave the mages by themselves, they are likely to die alone.
But they might be able to run away with the blade.

Level them if they defeat the Prince of Daemons.
Demogorgon leaves once Irae is satisfied.

Irae's been scrying on the party successfully. If they try to escape with the artifact, she will follow them.


## Irae tactics
### Time Stop (PLOT - 40s)
Everything goes gray. Not in the sense of you losing control, but in the sense that there is only darkness. You do not see nor hear anything. You do not exist. Except for you Mordai. You see the world. Grey, black mist swirling all around you. Your movement, limited, but your hands responsive, yet slowed. You look around, all your party members, Goatweaver, Faey, mages, all frozen in time. Yet to the side, Hanir, stands there, glitchily flickering in and out of what can only be described as a temporal time stop. As your vision shifts, an elven figure comes into view, casting dim blue light, and has a trail of smoke around her figure, she steps towards you. As her strong jawline and flesh hits the moonlights it reveals hollow bone beneath her illusionism.

(When she sees Mordai not affected). How interesting. You understand the flow of time yourself.
Fulfilling a prophecy, of course. You of all people should know this. Creatures do not exist in this timeline unless they have been interferring.
"And what are you going to do? You are too late. By the time the baboon's face stares down the soul of your desparate champions, I will be long gone."


Casting chronomancy within timestop will summon Dahaka.

If Demogorgon is delayed for many rounds, Irae might swoop in if she feels comfortable.

### Ways to save it
Don't be a dick: throw in a Feeblemind/Fear against party or a tentacle against champions if they are in serious trouble (near death or too charmed)
Felgolos will arrive near the end (deus ex machina). DC21 DEX SAVE VS FIRE.
