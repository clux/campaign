## Post-Irae
Ursula has been scrying worriedly at Neverwinter. Sees events happening. Baphomet near Neverwinter. Yeenoghu has hit Luskan.

Trade routes rough. Gem prices already up 4x after mines cut off. Last shipment from Neverwinter yesterday expected to be the last. Food supplies still okay. Fisheries doing well, trade ships repurposed as fishing vessels.
