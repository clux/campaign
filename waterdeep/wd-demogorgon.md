# Waterdeep Siege
Battleplan for [[irae]], Kua-Toans + Demogorgon assaulting Waterdeep.

## Pre-battle Prep
Mages will slowly uncover lore about Shario (Diano knows basic, Ursula can research as she believes it). Slowly uncover bits and bobs every day. Learn about the final battle just before.

They can visit the tomb of Shario below Castle Waterdeep (middle of mountain, sealed). Winding tunnel. Several seals, and several magical keys. First have to spend two hours magically excavating the tunnel. At the bottom, a single room with 2x Deva's + Planetar (to make sure it's not lied to) returning as soon at they touch. If their intentions are good they can POSSIBLY see the body. But need super persuasive powers to take the amulet.


## General Plan
Demogorgon + 50 Kua-Toans coming up from the sewer grates.
Shooshar running up before everything? Rides a giant turtle from darklake.
One Kua-Toan will ask for the blade of shadows, or the Prince of Shadows will come to retrieve it himself.

Attack will happen at mid day, but dark mist covers the air (~mirage arcana), blocks out the sun.

Mages will defend the city against Demogorgon. Delayed blast fireball. Demo will pick it up if it's too soon. Ursula: "Don't look it in the eyes."
Demogorgon will smash the mages tower (massive bludgeoning to everyone inside) so the safe with the blade gets to ground level.

While the battle rages, Irae will swoop in to grab it. NB: Don't do this at all costs. If they escape with it, she'll definitely stalk them at night.

If they leave the mages by themselves, they are likely to die alone.
But they might be able to run away with the blade.

Level them if they defeat the Prince of Daemons.
Demogorgon leaves once Irae is satisfied.

Irae's been scrying on the party successfully. If they try to escape with the artifact, she will follow them.


## Irae tactics
### Time Stop (PLOT - 40s)
Just before: As the battle rages on and the darkness now covering the entire sky, it feels like you are in the midst of an eclipse, while all the spells light up the city from below. The mist, however, swirls like a tornado above you.

As the mists swirls intensify, you start noticing a shape in the midst of this now very circular eye of the storm. Big black arcane runes etched into the sky.

Everything goes gray. Not in the sense of you losing control, but in the sense that there is only darkness. You do not see nor hear anything. You do not exist. Except for you Mordai. You see the world. Grey, black mist swirling all around you at a different rate. Your body, restrained by an inherent slowness. You slowly look around, all your party members, Goatweaver, Faey, mages, all frozen in time. Yet to the side, Hanir, floats in the air, mid jump, glitchily flickering in and out of existence. As you slowly turn your head up towards the darkness, an elven figure floating into view, casting dim blue light from the luminescent smoke trailing her figure. As her strong jawline and flesh reaches a certain point of proximity, the illusion is broken; you see reveals hollow bone covering her face.

(When she sees Mordai not affected). How interesting. You understand the flow of time yourself.
*Casts higher level locate object (divination 3)* (does not proc timestop end)

Why/what?
Fulfilling a prophecy, of course. You of all people should know this. Creatures do not exist in this timeline unless they have been tampering with it.
Arklem? Hah, always quick to acquiesce when tempted.


"And what are you going to do? You are too late. By the time the baboon's face stares down the soul of your desparate champions, I will be long gone."
(didn't say this because i proc'd timestop as demogorgon died)

Once she takes the bag, it procs timestop. She will then use movement to fly 50ft away. Cast spells as legendary action/reaction.

Casting chronomancy within timestop will summon Dahaka.

### Spells
Time Stop (to steal blade when she sees it - won't affect Mordai)
Metor Swarm: 78 fire dmg, 63 bludgeoning dmg - in panic

### Ways to save it
Don't be a dick: throw in a Feeblemind/Fear against party or a tentacle against champions if they are in serious trouble (near death or too charmed)
Felgolos will arrive near the end (deus ex machina). DC21 DEX SAVE VS FIRE.
Champions can tank some tentacles?

Ursula:

- Beacon of Hope / Dispel / Lesser Restoration / Sanctuary / Protection from Evil and Good
- Protection Reaction: impose disadv on attack roll when you see a target attack other than you <=5ft

## Recap Demogorgon battle
Music: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAGo5aYhPw4 (celeste awake)

Defended the city of Waterdeep from the prince of daemons.
An destructive battle that raged on for 7 rounds, even with an array of mages, millitia, archers helping from the sidelines, and even with a hasted, beaconed, holy weaponed paladin unloading all his radiant energy at his disposal, the battle was raged on as black mist started swirling above the battle field.

The mage guild were present, but unfortunately most of their protective magic and healing was useless against demogorgon's health max draining attacks, and protections.

Hans was charmed by this fiendish baboon, and cast cone of cold on Mordai.
Faey was charmed, punched GW to the ground and kept going after he fell.

The sky started crackling with arcane energy as the swirly above converged, and in the eye of a storm; large black arcane runes became visible.

Goatweaver came back up from a cure wounds delivered via Mordai's familiar and he dealt another 102 damage before misty stepping away leaving demogorgon mortally wounded.

Still, this was not enough to take him down, so next time around, the fiend followed and killed GW (reduced to 0 max hp), and almost took Faey with him afterwards (he was very low).

From the church above, Mordai did deliver the final inflict wounds via proxy familiar. However, just as this hit, time stopped. Irae swooped down to see everyone frozen, except Mordai, strangely, who seemed to be somewhat resistent to the effects of the time-altering magic.

On a path to "fulfilling a prophecy", she cut the band around the bag of holding, ending the time stop, and she started flying away with it.

This now caused a race between the wizard Lotte, starting a resurrection ritual below after having gotten Hans and Faey. But Mordai ushered Faey to focus on Irae instead.

In the end, Irae got away, but not without suffering significant damage (her defenses did not look super impressive). Goatweaver, otoh, laid there as the resurrection ritual began to fade..

### Goatweaver intro
Goatweaver, you are here today, because Hans reminded you of something deep within your soul; a purpose, you still have left unfilfilled.

Less than an hour ago; you were unloading radiant energy on a divine scale into the prince of demons. Its corpse still twitching from leftover nerve impulses less than 20m away from you. That only a few archers and members of the militia lie dead on the ground is a miracle. You should feel like a hero.

But something is amiss. You look at your friend Hans, having just helped to pull you up, you are greeted with a smile as he moves in to give you a hug; his aura warms your spirit.

But looking beyond Hans, there's a more ambivalent feel over battlefield. The destruction is enormous. The mages, the rest of your party somewhat distant.

Checking:
You look over to your lawful elf, and see the master manipulator you've come to appreciate on the battlefield. Capable of locking down almost any enemy, and deflecting damage away from the party. WIS: 10. But how well do you really understand him? WIS: 20 You get the sense that something else happened when you were out.

Then there's the thiefling. A mastermind, always on the hunt for knowledge and as far as you can tell, in it for some definition of the greater good. WIS 20: You get the sense that he experienced something else while you were out.

### Felgolos Return
"I have returned. You have done well, champions. This beast, must have been a formidable foe."

-> Diana will interact:

"Felgolos. The champions told of your arrival, but I must say, I am still surprised to see you here."
"The pleasure is all mine, mylady." - then transform.

Learning of Irae's assembly:

"(choking) No."
"So she controls these fiends, and now, she has the artifacts of Kiaransalee. Heavens."
"(stumbles) I have lived too long. Even time feels cyclical."

Speculating on Irae:

"That I do not know. The scythe, fully formed, is an almost unstoppable force by itself. Does she intend to wield it? Or can she bring her back?"

..what can he do? Bring them east. Teleport with them north, travel further up.

He can help fight Frygt at Halos. But he'll be trapped if he goes to V'elddrinnsshar - knows the drow has done terrible things to dragons in the past to sustain the most powerful pets imaginable.
Knows the fight happened east of the netherese empire. Can tell you the location of Sunwuko's tomb.
