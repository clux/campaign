TODO: flesh out specific entrance to make it scary.

## Main entrance
Small obvious hatch hidden behind some shrubbery. But easy to spot tracks (10Surv)

## Inside

Definitely have a quick side entrance with trip wire DC30 perception.
They'll be taken through the danger area, switches on the wall pulled to keep them from falling in.
A "more obvious path" that's laden with caltrops. Difficult terrain for >small. Trip wires further in.

## What's in the other rooms?
Breeding rooms for goats (hear bleating underneath one of them) (kennel)
Barracks (5 Swolebolds)
Hareem (8 female kobolds)
Audience chamber (traps, but meepo is there with 2 swolebolds – 3 from baracks nearby)
Storage rooms hidden away.
Guard sleep rooms behind those even.
Side passage that's covered in cobwebs and smells damp (abandoned side passage). Still got a trap there.
20 kobolds (8 armed) eating stew from large cauldron, workshop?

Manually triggered poison room trap.

## Back entrance
At the back of the hill. 30min trackind around.
Hive with Crawler from act5 d3. Shakes up tons of tiny ones as action.

Afterwards, trap down to Moraga's lair. Where he and Rakanishu are conversing.
Basically an umberhulk in dmg, but 15AC and no mind controll, no arms, just solid bite. (292mm)
+9 hit 3d8+13 slashing. Can grapple if it wants..
Alternatively: spawn 10 broods: Badger stats (10AC,  3HP, +2 hit, 2dmg) - 318mm

## Below
Master Moraga. LE human, dressed in a green cloak, green boots. Yellow piercing eyes.
Next to Rakanishu. A CN kobold wizard with a wand of smiles and makeshift antlers strapped to his head.
Lots of air in this tunnel (hidden opening at top of mountain)

A disguised young green dragon wants powerfood. (to beef up? Ingredient in ritual?)
Irenicus style. A bit shifty, british, but believable.
Performing experiments, and kobolds help in exchange for his expertise.
He's taught them basic magic. Wants goats, or even better,  source of food.

## Moraga Lines
"What brings adventurers deep inside a lair like this without reinforcements?"
"Such confidence. You are entitled to your view, but these are no ordinary kobolds"
"I provide tactics and intelligence so that these creatures can live an almost undetected life, whilst of course bringing me what I need to conduct my research.
"I am a ..researcher. There's been an increase in magical energy seeping up from the underdark, and I'm using some of it on these kobolds to.. Shall we say.. Enhance their capabilities."

DC20 Perc. check => kobold is avoiding your gaze.
DC25 Inv. Check => lies.

"Say, you do look a little more capable than your average guns-for-hire."
"Can I perhaps interest you in a deal?. I have no desire to bring all my followers in here to fight you, and I'm sure you're smart enough not to pick such a fight."
"There's a village not too far from here that's managing to breed some very impressive animals."
"We've captured one or two, and as you may have been able to tell, they've had an impressive effect on this colony."
"Unfortunately, the goats' immediate offspring, lacks the same impressiveness."
"If you could bring back a barrel or two of their food, I could reward you handsomely."
"Besides, the villagers would almost certainly be better off without such a curse hanging over them."
"The 10 remaining people there can be escorted to the coast."

## Thoughts
First: Annoyed that there are people here. But he's playing it off a little more in his actions.
Then: Hopeful that you might be useful after all, but still ^.
Probing: "They might be useful. But they feel pretty shifty. He's looking at you and Mordai a lot, and you get the feeling that if it comes to a fight, based on the feelings you're extracting from him, the two of you are probably going to be targetted.
Probe response: "Well, isn't that just rude. Rakanishu! *hold person*."
"It's ungracious to probe into another creature's mind at a first meeting."
Probing Rak: "I hope master eats these humans." (then he alerts Moraga about it...)

## If they accept
"Your service is much appreciated. We will escort you out of here."
"Please do not disappoint me. This is too trivial for the likes of us to squabble over."

### Reward:
Black powder
Magical ink. For 3500g tattoo.
Boots of flying (display fake flying – DC20 Arcana)

## If they refuse
"I'm sad to see you choose this particular path, but I can't say I'm surprised. You are a group of stubborn egoists who seem to be suffering from delusions of adequacy."
"Let's us not bore one another any further, and leave this place."

Half way through, ambush them with tons of kobolds. Swolbolds.
4 elite kobolds (weak but has intro cone attack for 4d6 fire DC13 dex)
6 kobolds (one shotteable, AC12, d4+2 dmg, +4 hit)
6 kobold archers (slings, same dmg as kobolds, but use slings with rocks)
1 or 2 junk shaman (weak, ac15junk armor, +5 to hit flame jet 2d6 dmg +d6 per turn)
1 kobold dragonshield (ac15 shield, poison res, can save for everyone, d6+1 x2 spear)
4 swolebolds (ac14 60hp, scary,  front line, slams, 2d6+4 dmg, +6 hit, grapple dc14, then crush 5d6+4 dmg)

They do NOT want to get close for the crush, but the rest is not particularly scary.
Later on: meepo reinforcement with shotgun.

## Meepo Lines
- "Ohh, you no worry, new master very smart. He make kobold bigger."
- "He answer all question."
- "He want respect. He take help."
- "You provide those. People. Social masters."
- "By glory of rakanishu."
- "Make bigger boom to people town."
- "Lots of sheepses."
- "Dangerous tunnels, full of dangerous things. We avoid them. We do."
- Are there many? "A few."
- Are there many right now? "Dunno, I've been away for a while."
- When do you eat? "When there's food."
- How is your leader? "He good leader."

## Meepo stats
18AC – 18DEX (super dodgy now). Poison res from dragon. Can save at start of turn (like dragon shield).
50ish HP. 3d8 shotgun close range, 2d8 dist. 1d8 far.

## Deception
Kobolds generally doesn't know he's a dragon. The wizard does. <-yes
(Maybe they think there's a dragon further in. "Wizard" will agree. <- Nah.)

## Treasure
Staff of smiles!
Large black emerald (2k gp)

## Tattoos
https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LCger_-0N85d-tKgKRK
All <2000gp.
Promised tattoo ink.
Cleanliness save vs hard grit injury?

 ## Kobold Comebacks
- One of the two of us is dumber than me.
- You continue to meet my expectations.
- I hope your day is just as pleasant as you are.
- You seem to be suffering from delusions of adequacy.
- If ____ was a spice, she'd be flour.
- Your secret is safe with my indifference.
- You may not be the dumbest person on Earth, but you better hope he doesn't die.
