## Lines
Well, of course silly. She's great. Umberlee (twang). She controls the weather and strength of the sea, and grants the worthy safe passage. Those who aren't. Well. The Wavemother has plans for them still.

I need you to swear allegiance to the Wavemother. And you shall soon have the support of any sea-creature. You will need to make a pilgrimage to see Slarkrethel and perform your duties and oaths, but we can look at that later silly. I'll be able to assist you in my current form without your full cooperation, but my power will grow when we are in tune with one another.

Moonshae isles?

## Personality (as per default):

When it grows restless, Wave has a habit of humming tunes that vary from sea chanteys to sacred hymns of the sea gods.

Wave zealously desires to convert mortals to the worship of one or more sea gods, or else to consign the faithless to death. Conflict arises if the wielder fails to further the weapon’s objectives in the world.

The trident has a nostalgic attachment to the place where it was forged, a desolate island called Thunderforge. A sea god imprisoned a family of storm giants there, and the giants forged Wave in an act of devotion to—or rebellion against—that god.

Wave harbors a secret doubt about its own nature and purpose. For all its devotion to the sea gods, Wave fears that it was intended to bring about a particular sea god’s demise. This destiny is something Wave might not be able to avert.
