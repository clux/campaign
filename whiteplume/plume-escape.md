# Whiteplume Escape
2x CR11 Efreeti? Holy shit. 130-260HP AC 17.
One weak, does only Hurl Flame twice. One beefy, only uses scimitar. One way of weakening them a bit.
Still. Lethal. Describe muscles + natural armor (22STR, how plate like it feels).
Conjures elemental once (if easy). Invisibility to make it fun. Wall of fire.
Can enlarge for Huge + d4 extra dmg on weapons.

Have extra weapons (large vs. For enrage mechanic)
Hjarka will hate them.

## Tune down
They're close to a CR9 creature if you just take down to +7 to hit.
If every other hit, hits, they're pretty OK.
Canonical damage range is:
Scimitars: 20-60 dmg (mostly piercing some fire) (+10 hit, meelee) (avg 75%hits => 30 pr)
Hurl flame:  10-60 fire dmg (+7 hit - 120ft) (avg half hits => 25 per round)
Wall of fire (4 people hit): 20-160 fire dmg (dex save vs all)
Caveats to fire: fire resist infernal, evasion rogue, +2 saves pala => 2+ saves avg
Implies => 15-120 avg => 52 dmg avg per round
=> Wall MVP > Scimitars > Hurl flame
=> 35pr per efreeti avg => 70dmg per round
Players have 200.
So less than 3 rounds and they're out.
They can lose one in one round. Let them go first.
Maybe dial down to hit a bit. => need to have no hit rounds occasionally.

## Recap
Highlight that they got last sword by not breaking the glass. WOuldn't have otherwise.

## Intro
Slam scimitar down into floor to intimidate.
"You. Will come with us."
"We serve the mighty Keraptis, you will do well to embrace his rule."
"We have no time for this insubordination."
Slam weapon towards on of theirs as an intimidating way to disarm one.
"Are you sure you wish to go down this path?" Says while a smile is increasingly forming on his face.
Hand gripping his scimitar withincreasing power.
"Nox. It's time to showcase the true origin of fire."

## Reason: escape
Timers. 1 round in roof will start to shake.
Further away from the source the elementals are weaker.
They weaken over time anyway?
Appearing out of holes in the wall, and slowly reforming. A smile forms on his face, but it looks considerably more stressed.

## Near end lines
"You... Will.. Return. (heavy breathing).

## In case of wipe or capture.
### Epilogue
They are slaves to Keraptis.
At least ones that survive.
All gear they had is no herein.

X-Men style magneto room where they are slowly mind controlled. WIS saves of increasing power as they get closer.
